<string>468 A Child of the King
Hattie E. Buel          John B. Sumner
1
My Father is rich in houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.

Refrain
I'm a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus, my Savior,
I'm a child of the King!

2
My Father's own Son, the Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is pleading for sinners on high,
And will give me a home when He comes by and by.

3
I once was an outcast, stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted, my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown.

4
A tent or a cottage, O why should I care?
They're building a palace for me over there!
Though exiled from home, yet still I may sing:
"All glory to God, I'm a child of the King."

<string>639 A Diligent and Grateful Heart
Raymond Gunn          Ancient Irish Melody
1
A diligent and grateful heart
Prompts me to sing Thy praise.
Thy love and mercies from the start
Have blessed me all my days.

2
I thank Thee for the means to serve
With talents and with tithes,
For sharing brings the utmost joy
When lifting other lives.

3
My thanks I give for stewardship
To minister through deeds,
To serve and share with patient care
Thy people in their needs.

4
O Lord, I dedicate my all
In this response to Thee.
Help me to magnify this call
In deep humility.

<string>228 A Hymn of Glory Let Us Sing
Lutheran Book of Worship          Ralph Vaughan Williams
1
A hymn of glory let us sing;
New hymns thro'-out the world shall ring.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Christ, by a road before untrod,
Ascends unto the throne of God.
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

2
O Lord, our homeward pathway bend,
That our unwearied hearts ascend.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Where, seated on Your Father's throne,
You reign as King of kings alone.
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

3
Give us Your joy on earth, O Lord,
In heav'n to be our great reward.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
When throned with You forever, we
Shall praise Your name eternally.
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
All praise to You let earth accord:
Alleluia! Alleluia!

<string>506 A Mighty Fortress
Frederick H. Hedge          Martin Luther
1
A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;
Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

2
Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing,
Were not the right man on our side, the man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He,
Lord Sabaoth, His name, from age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.

3
And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us.
The prince of darkness grim, we tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, for lo! his doom is sure;
One little word shall fell him.

4
That word above all earthly powers, no thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;
The body they may kill; God's truth abideth still;
His kingdom is forever. 
</string>

<string>503 A Quiet Place
Ralph Carmichael          Ralph Carmichael
There is a quiet place,
Far from the rapid pace where God can soothe my troubled mind.
Sheltered by tree and flow'r,
There in my quiet hour with Him my cares are left behind.
Whether a garden small,
Or on a mountain tall,
New strength and courage there I find;
Then from this quiet place
I go prepared to face a new day
With love for all mankind. 
</string>

<string>528 A Shelter in the Time of Storm
Vernon J. Charlesworth          F. E. Belden
1
The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever may betide,
A shelter in the time of storm.

Refrain
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling shade on the burning sand,
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band;
A shelter in the time of storm.

2
A shade by day, defense by night,
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes affright,
A shelter in the time of storm.

3
The raging floods may round us beat,
A shelter in the time of storm;
We find in God a safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.

4
O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
A Shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our helper, ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm.

<string>472 A Song of Heaven and Homeland
E. E. Rexford          Ira D. Sankey
1
Sometimes I hear strange music, Like none e'er heard before,
Come floating softly earthward As thro' heav'n's open door:
It seems like angel voices, In strains of joy and love,
That swell the mighty chorus Around the throne above. 

Refrain
O sweet, celestial music, Heard from a land afar.
The song of Heav'n and Homeland, Thro' doors God leaves ajar!

2
Now soft, and low, and restful, It floods my soul with peace,
As if God's benediction Bade all earth's troubles cease.
Then grander than the voices, Of wind, and wave, and sea.
It fills the dome of heaven With glorious harmony.

3
This music haunts me ever, Like something heard in dreams.
It seems to catch the cadence Of heav'nly winds and streams,
My heart is filled with rapture, To think, some day to come,
I'll sing it with the angels. The song of heav'n and home. 
</string>

<string>50 Abide With Me
Henry F. Lyte          William H. Monk
1
Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

2
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou, who changest not, abide with me!

3
I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!

4
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me! 
</string>

<string>46 Abide With Me, 'Tis Eventide
M. Lowrie Hofford          Harrison Millard
1
Abide with me, 'tis eventide!
The day is past and gone;
The shadows of the evening fall;
The night is coming on!
Within my heart a welcome guest,
Within my home abide;

Refrain
O Savior, stay this night with me;
Behold, 'tis eventide!
O Savior, stay this night with me;
Behold, 'tis eventide.

2
Abide with me, 'tis eventide!
Thy walk today with me
Has made my heart within me burn,
As I communed with Thee.
Thy earnest words have filled my soul
And kept me near Thy side;

3
Abide with me, 'tis eventide!
And lone will be the night,
If I cannot commune with Thee,
Nor find in Thee my light.
The darkness of the world, I fear,
Would in my home abide;

John M. Neale          Melchior Teschner

All glory, laud, and honor,
To Thee, Redeemer, King,
To whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring.
Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou David's royal Son,
Who in the Lord's name comest,
The King and Blessed One.

2
The company of angels
Are praising Thee on high,
And mortal men and all things
Created make reply.
The people of the Hebrews
With psalms before Thee went;
Our praise and prayer and anthems
Before Thee we present.

3
To Thee, before Thy passion,
They sang their hymns of praise;
To Thee, now high exalted,
Our melody we raise.
Thou didst accept their praises;
Accept the praise we bring,
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King.

<string>5 All My Hope on God Is Founded
Robert Bridges          Herbert Howells
1
All my hope on God is founded;
He doth still my trust renew.
Me through change and chance He guideth,
Only good and only true.
God unknown, He alone
Calls my heart to be His own.

2
Pride of man and earthly glory,
Sword and crown betray his trust;
What with care and toil he buildeth,
Tower and temple fall to dust.
But God's power, hour by hour,
Is my temple and my tower.

3
God's great goodness aye endureth,
Deep His wisdom, passing thought;
Splendor, light and life attend Him,
Beauty springeth out of naught.
Love doth stand at His hand;
Joy doth wait on His command.

4
Still from man to God eternal,
Sacrifice of praise be done.
High above all praises praising,
For the gift of Christ His Son.
Christ doth call one and all:
Ye who follow shall not fall.

All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.

Come ye before Him and rejoice.

2
Know that the Lord is God indeed;
Without our aid He did us make;
We are His folk, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.

3
O enter then His gates with praise;
Approach with joy His courts unto;
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do.

4
For why! the Lord our God is good;
His mercy is forever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.

Beneath Thine own almighty wings.

2
Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,
The ill that I this day have done,
That with the world, myself, and Thee,
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

3
O may my soul on Thee repose,
And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close,
Sleep that may me more vigorous make
To serve my God when I awake.

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all creatures here below;
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Love of Christ so freely given,
Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea.

Every need His hand supplying,
Every good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying,
He is All in All to me.

With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King.

All the way my Savior leads me; What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy, Who through life has been my guide?
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort, Here by faith in Him to dwell;
For I know what-e'er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well;
For I know what-e'er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well. 

2
All the way my Savior leads me; Cheers each winding path I tread;
Gives me grace for every trial, Feeds me with the living bread;
Though my weary steps may falter, And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before me, Lo, a spring of joy I see;
Gushing from the Rock before me, Lo, a spring of joy I see.

3
All the way my Savior leads me; O the fullness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised In my Father's house above;
When I wake to life immortal, Wing my flight to realms of day,
This my song through endless ages, Jesus led me all the way;
This my song through endless ages, Jesus led me all the way.

John Greenlead Whittier          Wm. Gardiner Sacred Melodies

All things are Thine; no gift have we,
Lord of all gifts, to offer Thee;
And hence with grateful hearts today,
Thine own before Thy feet we lay.

Thy will was in the builder's thought;
Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;
Thro' mortal motive, scheme and plan,
Thy wise, eternal purpose ran.

3
No lack Thy perfect fullness knew;
For human needs and longings grew
This house of prayer this home of rest.
Here may Thy saints be often blessed.

4
In weakness and in want we call
On Thee, for whom the heav'ns are small;
Thy glory is Thy children's good,
Thy joy Thy tender Fatherhood.

O Father! deign these walls to bless;
Make this the abode of righteousness,
And let these doors a gateway be
To lead us from ourselves to Thee!

The sunset, and the morning
That brightens up the sky.

And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.

Is this vile world a friend to grace, to help me on to God?

Sure I must fight if I would reign; increase my courage, Lord;

When that illustrious day shall rise, and all Thy armies shine
In robes of victory through the skies, the glory shall be Thine.

Amazing love! How can it be

And bled for Adam's helpless race;
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For O my God, it found out me!

Long my imprisoned spirit lay,
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,

My chains fell off, my heart was free;

And clothed in righteousnes divine,
Bold I approach th'eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

And to God's loving care their lives confide.

<string>129 As It Fell Upon a Night
Katherine K. Davis          Geoffrey Shaw
1
As it fell upon a night
In the winter weather,
Angels bright in starry height
Began to sing together.

2
Shepherds sleeping on the plain
Woke to see the glory,
All amazed they stood and gazed
And heard the angels' story.

3
Unto you a child is born
In a manger lowly,
Humble, He, yet born to be
The King of Love most holy.

4
Happy angels from afar,
Cease your singing never!
In excelsis gloria!
Forever and forever.

<string>628 As Jacob With Travel Was Weary
18th Century          G. H. Knight
1
As Jacob with travel was weary one day,
At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;
He saw in a vision a ladder so high
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.

Refrain
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.

2
Come let us ascend! all may climb it who will;
For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:
And remember each step that by faith we pass o'er,
Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.

3
And when we arrive at the haven of rest
We shall hear the glad words, "Come up hither, ye blest,
Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss."
O who would not climb such a ladder as this?

<string>113 As Pants the Hart
Nahum Tate and Nicholas Brady          Robert A. Smith
1
As pants the hart for cooling streams
When heated in the chase,
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,
And Thy refreshing grace.

2
For Thee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine:
O when shall I behold Thy face,
Thou Majesty divine?

3
Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still, and thou shalt sing
The praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy health's eternal spring.

4
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, is now,
And shall be evermore.

<string>556 As Saints of Old
Frank von Christiersons           Leland B. Sateren
1
As saints of old their first fruits brought
Of orchard, flock, and field
To God, the giver of all good,
The source of bounteous yield;
So we today first fruits would bring,
The wealth of this good land,
Of farm and market, shop and home,
Of mind, and heart, and hand.

2
A world in need now summons us
To labor, love, and give;
To make our life an offering
To God, that all may live.
The Church of Christ is calling us
To make the dream come true:
A world redeemed by Christ-like love;
All life in Christ made new.

3
In gratitude and humble trust
We bring our best today
To serve Your cause and share Your love
With all along life's way.
O God, who gave Yourself to us
In Jesus Christ Your Son,
Teach us to give ourselves each day
Until life's work is done.

As the treasure in the coffer,
As the manna in the ark,

As the light within the lantern,
As the father in the home,

As song-time and springtime and summertime to be,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.

Like calm in place of clamor
Like peace that follows pain,
Like meeting after parting,
Like sunshine after rain;
Like moonlight and starlight and sunlight on the sea,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.

As sleep that follows fever,
As gold instead of grey,
As freedom after bondage,
As sunrise to the day;
As home to the trav'ler and all he longs to see,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.

Join us now as we come to You in prayer.

<string>123 As With Gladness Men of Old
William C. Dix          Melvin West
1
As with gladness men of old
Did the guiding star behold,
As with joy they hailed its light,
Leading onward, beaming bright,
So, most gracious Lord, may we
Evermore be led to Thee.

2
As with joyful steps they sped
To that lowly manger bed,
There to bend the knee before
Him whom heav'n and earth adore,
So may we with willing feet
Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

3
As they offered gifts most rare
At that manger rude and bare,
So may we with holy joy,
Pure, and free from sin's alloy,
All our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee our heav'nly King.

4
Holy Jesus, every day
Keep us in the narrow way;
And, when earthly things are past,
Bring our ransomed souls at last
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

<string>488 At First I Prayed for Light
Mrs. E. D. Cheney          C. E. Kettle
1
At first I prayed for light:
Could I but see the way,
How gladly, swiftly would I walk
To everlasting day!

2
And next I prayed for strength:
That I might tread the road
With firm, unfaltering feet, and win
The heaven's serene abode.

3
And then I asked for faith:
Could I but trust my God,
I'd live infolded in His peace,
Though foes were all abroad.

4
But now I pray for love:
Deep love to God and man;
A living love that will not fail,
However dark His plan.

5
And light and strength and faith
Are opening everywhere!
God waited patiently until
I prayed the larger prayer.

Isaac Watts           Ralph E. Hudson
1
Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For sinners such as I?

Refrain
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!

2
Was it for crimes that I have done,
He suffered on the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away;
'Tis all that I can do!

<string>232 At the Name of Jesus
Caroline M. Noel          Ralph Vaughan Williams
1
At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow,
Every tongue confess Him King of glory now;
'Tis the Father's pleasure we should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning was the mighty Word.

2
At His voice creation sprang at once to sight,
All the angel faces, All the hosts of light,
Thrones and dominations stars upon their way,
All the heavenly orders in their great array.

3
Humbled for a season, To receive a name
From the lips of sinners, Unto whom He came;
He is God the Savior, He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshiped, Trusted and adored.

4
In your hearts enthrone Him: There let Him subdue
All that is not holy, All that is not true;
Crown Him as your captain in temptation's hour,
Let His will enfold you in its light and power.

5
Surely, this Lord Jesus shall return again,
With His Father's glory, With His angel train;
For all wreaths of empire meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him King of glory now.

Shout with their shout of praise;

Great lord of years and days!

To spend thyself nor count the cost;
To serve right gloriously
The God who gave all worlds that are,
And all that are to be.

To thine aspiring eye.

A cloud of witnesses around
Hold thee in full survey;

And onward urge thy way.

Blest Savior, introduced by Thee,
Our race have we begun;
And, crowned with victory, at Thy feet
We'll lay our trophies down.

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes.
I love Thee, Lord Jesus! look down from the sky,
And stay by my side till the morning is nigh.

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven, to live with Thee there.

And say He died for all.

In every change He faithful will remain.

Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last. Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.

Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored. Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

Because He lives all fear is gone;
Because I know He holds the future.
And life is worth the living just because He lives.

But greater still the calm assurance,
This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

1
Before Jehovah's awful throne,
Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;
Know that the Lord is God alone;
He can create, and He destroy.

2
His sovereign power, without our aid,
Made us of clay, and formed us men;
And when like wandering sheep we strayed,
He brought us to His fold again.

3
We'll crowd His gates with thankful songs,
High as the heavens our voices raise;
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.

4
Wide as the world is His command,
Vast as Eternity His love;
Firm as a rock His truth shall stand,
When rolling years shall cease to move.

<string>303 Beneath the Cross of Jesus
Elizabeth C. Clephane          Frederick C. Maker
1
Beneath the cross of Jesus I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty rock within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness, a rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat, and the burden of the day.

2
Upon that cross of Jesus mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One who suffered there for me;
And from my stricken heart with tears two wonders I confess:
The wonders of redeeming love and my unworthiness.

3
I take, O cross, thy shadow for my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by, to know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame, my glory all the cross.

1
Beneath the forms of outward rite
Thy supper, Lord, is spread
In every quiet upper room
Where fainting souls are fed.

2
The bread is always consecrate
Which men divide with men;
And every act of brotherhood
Repeats Thy feast again.

3
The blessed cup is only passed
True memory of Thee,
When life anew pours out its wine
With rich sufficiency.

O Master, through these symbols shared,

That in our daily life may flame
The passion of Thy heart.

Perfect submission, all is at rest;
I in my Savior am happy and blest,
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

3
We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part,

But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.

And be Thy feast to us the token
That by Thy grace our souls are fed. Amen.

Through the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
When our weeping's over He will bid us welcome,

<string>347 Built on the Rock
Carl Doving         Ludvig M. Linderman
1
Built on the Rock the Church shall stand,
Even when steeples are falling;
Crumbled have spires in every land,
Bells still are chiming and calling
Calling the young and old to rest,
Calling the souls of those distressed,
Longing for life everlasting.

2
Not in our temples made with hands
God, the Almighty, is dwelling;
High in the heav'ns His temple stands,
All earthly temples excelling.
Yet He who dwells in heav'n above
Deigns to abide with us in love,
Making our bodies His temple.

3
We are God's house of living stones,
Built for His own habitation;
He fills our hearts, His humble thrones,
Granting us life and salvation.
Were two or three to seek His face,
He in their midst would show His grace,
Blessings upon them bestowing.

4
Yet in this house, an earthly frame,
Jesus His children is blessing;
Hither we come to praise His name,
Faith in our Savior confessing.
Jesus to us His Spirit sent,
Making with us His covenant,
Granting His children the kingdom.

John M. Moore          John M. Moore
1
Days are filled with sorrow and care,
Hearts are lonely and drear;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.

Refrain
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Calvary, Calvary,
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.

Cast your care on Jesus today,
Leave your worry and fear;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.

Troubled soul, the Savior can see,
Every heartache and tear;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.

George Rawson          J. Bruce Ashton
1
By Christ redeemed, In Christ restored,
We keep the memory adored,
And show the death of our dear Lord,
Until He come.

2
His broken body in our stead
Is here, in his memorial bread;
And so our feeble love is fed,
Until He come.

3
His fearful drops of agony,
His lifeblood shed for us we see;
The wine shall tell the mystery,
Until He come.

4
And thus that dark betrayal night,
With the last advent we unite
The shame, the glory, by this rite,
Until He come.

<string>98 Can You Count the Stars
H. W. Dulcken          German Folk Tune
1
Can you count the stars that brightly
Twinkle in the midnight sky?
Can you count the clouds, so lightly
O'er the meadows floating by?
God, the Lord, doth mark their number
With His eyes that never slumber;
He hath made them every one,
He hath made them every one.

2
Can you count the wings now flashing
In the sunshine's golden light?
Can you count the fishes splashing
In the cooling waters bright?
God, the Lord, a name hath given,
To all creatures under heaven;
He hath named them every one,
He hath named them every one.

3
Do you know how many children
Rise each morning blithe and gay?
Can you count their jolly voices,
Singing sweetly day by day?
God hears all the happy voices,
In their merry songs rejoices;
And He loves them, every one,
And He loves them, every one.

William McComb          Benjamin Carr
1
Chief of sinners though I be,
Jesus shed His blood for me;
Died that I might live on high,
Died that I might never die;
As the branch is to the vine,
I am His, and He is mine.

2
O the height of Jesus' love!
Higher than the heaven above,
Deeper than the deepest sea,
Lasting as eternity;
Love that found me wondrous thought!
Found me when I sought Him not!

3
Chief of sinners though I be,
Christ is all in all to me;
All my wants to Him are known,
All my sorrows are His own;
Safe with Him from earthly strife,
He sustains the hidden life.

<string>101 Children of the Heavenly Father
Ernest W. Olson          Swedish Folk Melody
1
Children of the heavenly Father
Safely in His bosom gather;
Nestling bird nor star in heaven
Such a refuge e'er was given.

2
God His own doth tend and nourish,
In His holy love they flourish;
From all evil things He spares them,
In His mighty arms He bears them.

3
Neither life nor death shall ever
From the Lord His children sever;
Unto them His grace He showeth,
And their sorrows all He knoweth.

4
Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,
Your Protector never slumbers;
At the will of your Defender
Every foe-man must surrender.

5
Though He giveth or He taketh,
God His children ne'er forsaketh;
His the loving purpose solely
To preserve them pure and holy.

Samuel Wolcott          Felice de Giardini

The faint and overborne,
Sinsick and sorrow-worn,
Whom Christ doth heal.

The world to Christ we bring
With fervent prayer;
The wayward and the lost,
By restless passions tossed,
Redeemed at countless cost,
From dark despair.

The world to Christ we bring
With joyful song;
The newborn souls, whose days,
Reclaimed from error's ways,
Inspired with hope and praise,
To Christ belong.

Christ is alive! Let Christians sing.
His cross stands empty to the sky.
Let streets and homes with praises ring.
His love in death shall never die.

2
Christ is alive! No longer bound
To distant years in Palestine,
He comes to claim the here and now
And conquer every place and time.

3
In every insult, rift, and war
Where color, scorn or wealth divide,
He suffers still, yet loves the more,
And lives, though ever crucified.

Christ is alive! Ascended Lord
He rules the world His Father made,
Till, in the end, His love adored
Shall be to all on earth displayed.

Earth can now but tell the story
Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
She shall yet behold Thy glory
When Thou comest back to reign;

With that "blessed hope" before us,
Let no harp remain unstrung;
Let the mighty advent chorus
Onward roll from tongue to tongue:
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!

Christ is the world's true light,
Its captain of salvation,
The daystar clear and bright
Of every man and nation;

Where'er men own His sway:
Freedom her bondage breaks,
And night is turned to day.

In Christ all races meet,
Their ancient feuds forgeting,
The whole round world complete,
From sunrise to its setting:
When Christ is throned as Lord,
Men shall forsake their fear,
To plowshare beat the sword,
To pruning hook the spear.

One Lord, in one great name
Unite us all who own Thee,
Cast out our pride and shame
That hinder to enthrone Thee;
The world has waited long,
Has travailed long in pain,
To heal its ancient wrong,
Come, Prince of Peace, and reign.

Stands alone in glory blazing;
Let us, if we dare to speak,
With the saints and angels praise Him:

Refrain:

Trembling at His feet we saw
Moses and Elijah speaking;
All the prophets and the law
Shout thro' them their joyful greeting:

Swift the cloud of glory came,
God proclaiming in the thunder
Jesus as His Son by name;
Nations cry aloud in wonder!

4
This is God's beloved Son:
Law and prophets fade before Him;
First and last, the only One,
Let creation now adore Him.

Sun of Righteousness, arise,
Triumph o'er the shades of night;
Dayspring from on high, be near;
Daystar, in my heart appear.

Dark and cheerless is the morn
Unaccompanied by Thee;
Joyless is the day's return,
Till Thy mercy's beams I see;
Till they inward light impart,
Cheer my eyes and warm my heart.

Visit, then, this soul of mine;
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
Fill me, Radiancy divine;
Scatter all my unbelief;
More and more Thyself display,
Shining to the perfect day.

Gird thy heavenly armor on, Wear it ever, night and day;
Ambushed lies the evil one; Watch and pray!

Hear the victors who o'er-came; Still they mark each warrior's way;
All with one sweet voice exclaim: "Watch and pray!"

Hear, above all, hear thy Lord, Him thou lovest to obey;
Hide within thy heart His word; "Watch and pray!"

5
Watch, as if on that alone Hung the issue of the day;
Pray that help may be send down; Watch and pray!

Come down, O Love divine, Seek Thou this soul of mine,
And visit it with Thine own ardor glowing;
O Comforter, draw near, Within my heart appear,
And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.

2
O let it freely burn, Till earthly passions turn
To dust and ashes in its heat consuming;
And let Thy glorious light Shine ever on my sight,
And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.

3
Let holy charity Mine outward vesture be,
And lowliness become my inner clothing;
True lowliness of heart Which takes the humbler part,
And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.

4
And so the yearning strong, with which the soul will long,
Shall far outpass the power of human telling;
For none can guess its grace, Till he become the place
Where in the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling.

Long, long ago, the reapers, before they kept the feast,
Put first-fruits in a basket, and took it to the priest.

Shall we, sometimes forgetful of where creation starts,
With science in our pockets lose wonder from our hearts?

Accept these gifts we offer, our service and our songs.

And lest the world go hungry while we ourselves are fed,
Make each of us more ready to share our daily bread.

Loosed from Pharoah's bitter yoke Jacob's sons and daughters;
Led them with unmoistened foot Through the Red Sea waters.

'Tis the spring of souls today; Christ has burst His prison,
And from three days' sleep in death As a sun has risen;
All the winter of our sins, Long and dark, is flying
From His light, to whom is giv'n Laud and praise undying.

Now the queen of seasons, bright With the day of splendor,
With the royal feast of feasts, Comes its joy to render;
Comes to gladden faithful hearts Which with true affection
Welcome in unwearied strain Jesus' resurrection.

4
For today among the twelve Christ appeared, be stowing
His deep peace, which evermore Passes human knowing.
Neither could the gates of death, Nor the tomb's dark portal,
Nor the watchers, nor the seal, Hold Him as a mortal.

"Alleluia!" now we cry To our King immortal,
Who, triumphant, burst the bars Of the tomb's dark portal;
"Alleluia" with the Son, God the Father praising;
"Alleluia!" yet again To the Spirit raising.

John M. Neale          Arthur S. Sullivan
1
Come, you faithful, raise the strain
Of triumphant gladness;
God has brought His people forth
Into joy from sadness.
Now rejoice, Jerusalem,
And with true affection
Welcome in unwearied strains
Jesus' resurrection.

2
'Tis the spring of souls today;
Christ has burst His prison;
From the frost and gloom of death
Light and life have risen.
All the winter of our sins,
Long and dark, is flying
From His light, to whom we give
Thanks and praise undying.

3
"Alleluia!" now we cry
To our King immortal,
Who, triumphant, burst the bars
Of the tomb's dark portal;
"Alleluia!" with the Son,
God the Father praising;
"Alleluia!" yet again
To the Spirit raising.

<string>Count Your Blessings

1
When upon life's billows you are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings, name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

Refrain
Count your blessings, name them one by one,
Count your blessings, see what God hath done;
Count your blessings, name them one by one,
Count your many blessings, see what God hath done.

2
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.

3
When you look at others with their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high.

4
So, amid the conflict, whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, God is over all;
Count your many blessings, angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you to your journey's end.

Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;
Father, impute His life unto me.
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
Cover with His life, whiter than snow.

Fullness of His life then shall I know;
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
Cover with His life, whither than snow.

Deep are the wounds transgression has made;
Red are the stains; my soul is afraid.
O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,
Safe from the law that now judgeth me!

Longing the joy of pardon to know;
Jesus holds out a robe white as snow;
"Lord, I accept it! Leaving my own,
Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone."

Justified by His life pure and clean,
Sanctified by obeying His word,
Glorified when returneth my Lord.

From age to age eternally.

Godfrey Thring          George J. Elvey

Crown Him with many crowns, The Lamb upon His throne,
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns All music but its own.
Awake, my soul, and sing Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King through all eternity.

2
Crown Him the Lord of love! Behold His hands and side,
Those wounds, yet visible above, In beauty glorified;
No angel in the sky Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bend his wondering eye At mysteries so great.

Crown Him the Lord of peace! Whose hand a scepter sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease, And all be prayer and praise;
His reign shall know no end, And round His pierced feet
Fair flowers of Paradise extend, Their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown Him the Lord of years, The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres, Ineffably sublime!
All hail! Redeemer, hail! For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail Throughout eternity.

How to truly rest in Thee,
May Thy Sabbath peace enfold us
And our shelter ever be.

<string>532 Day by Day
A. L. Skoog          Melvin West
1
Day by day and with each passing moment,
Strength I find to meet my trials here;
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,
I've no cause for worry or for fear.
He whose heart is kind beyond all measure
Gives unto each day what He deems best.
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.

2
Every day, the Lord Himself is near me
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
He whose name is Counselor and Power.
The protection of His child and treasure
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
As your days, your strength shall be in measure,
This the pledge to me He made.

3
Help me then in every tribulation
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith's sweet consolation
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E'er to take, as from a Father's hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till I reach the promised land.

Heaven and earth are praising Thee,
O Lord most high!

Of the universe, Thy home,
Gather us who seek Thy face
To the fold of Thy embrace,
For Thou art nigh.

While the deepening shadows fall,
Heart of love enfolding all,
Thro' the glory and the grace
Of the stars that veil Thy face,
Our hearts ascend.

4
When forever from our sight
Pass the stars, the day, the night,
Lord of angels, on our eyes
Let eternal morning rise
And shadows end.

John Newton	Joachim Neader
1
Day of judgment, day of wonders! Hark the trumpet's awful sound,
Louder than a thousand thunders, Shakes the vast creation round!
How the summons Will the sinner's heart confound!

2
See the Lord in the glory nearing, Clothed in majesty divine,
You who long for His appearing, Then shall say, "This God is mine!"
Gracious Savior, Gracious Savior, Own me in that day as Thine.

3
At His call the dead awaken, Rise to life form earth and sea!
All the powers of nature shaken By His looks prepare to flee.
Careless sinner, Careless sinner, What will then become of thee?

4
But to those who have confessed Loved and served the Lord below,
He will say, "Come near, ye blessed, See the kingdom I bestow;
You forever, You forever Shall My love and glory know."

Dear Lord and Father of mankind, Forgive our foolish ways;
Reclothe us in our rightful mind, In purer lives Thy service find,
In deeper reverence, praise. In deeper reverence, praise.

In simple trust like theirs who heard, Beside the Syrian sea,
The gracious calling of the Lord, Let us, like them, without a word,
rise up and follow Thee, Rise up and follow Thee.

3
O sabbath rest by Galilee, O calm of hills above,
Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee The silence of eternity,
Interpreted by love, Interpreted by love.

4
Drop Thy still dews of quietness, Till all our strivings cease;
Take from our souls the strain and stress, And let our ordered lives confess
The beauty of Thy peace, The beauty of Thy peace.

5
Breathe thro' the heats of our desire, Thy coolness and Thy balm;
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire; Speak thro' the earthquake, wind, and fire,
O still small voice of calm. O still small voice of calm.

Still meet to praise their God.

Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.

Day by day, hour by hour,
Blessings are sent to me;

Near to Christ I would live,
Following Him each day;
What I ask He will give;
So then with faith I pray.

Now I have peace, sweet peace,
While in this world of sin;
But to pray I'll not cease
Till I am pure within.

<string>521 Depth of Mercy
Charles Welsey          William B. Bradbury
1
Depth of mercy! can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear?
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

2
I have long withstood His grace,
Long provoked Him to His face,
Would not hearken to His calls,
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.

3
Now incline me to repent;
Let me now my sins lament;
Now my foul revolt deplore,
Weep, believe, and sin no more.

4
There for me the Savior stands,
Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;
God is love! I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.

Frank E. Graeff          J. Lincoln Hall

Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
Too deeply for mirth and song;
As the burdens press, and the cares distress,
And the way grows weary and long?

Refrain
O yes, He cares I know He cares!
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary,
The long nights dreary,
I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)

2
Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near?

3
Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks
Is it aught to Him? Does He see?

Don't forget the Sabbath,

Its beams of light descending,
With heavenly beauty shine.

Blessed Sabbath day,
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
Blessed Sabbath day.

And worship Him today,

And if we meekly follow
Our Savior here below,
He'll give us of the fountain
Whose streams eternal flow.

Day of sacred pleasure!
Its golden hours we'll spend
In thankful hymns to Jesus,
The children's dearest Friend;

How precious is Thy promise
To dwell in every heart!

And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died.
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

May my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

In the name of Christ to sup,
Then with thanks to God the Father
Break the bread and bless the cup,

O Holy Spirit, who didst brood
Upon the waters dark and rude,
And bid their angry tumult cease,
And give, for wild confusion, peace:

O God of truth, whom science seeks And reverent souls adore,
Illumine every earnest mind Of every clime and shore:
Dispel the gloom of error's night, Of ignorance and fear,
Until true wisdom from above Shall make life's pathway clear!

O God of beauty, oft revealed In dreams of human art,
In speech that flows to melody, In holiness of heart:
Teach us to ban al ugliness, And all disharmony,
Till all shall know the loveliness Of lives made fair and free!

O God of righteousness and grace, Seen in the Christ, Your Son,
Whose life and death reveal Your face, By whom Your will was done;
Help us to spread Your gracious reign Till greed and hate shall cease,
And kindness dwell in human hearts, And all the earth find peace!

Show us, O Love, the quiet place of prayer,
The golden censer and the golden altar,
And the great angel waiting for us there.

The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread, And echo with our shout.

To him who overcomes the foe, White raiment shall be giv'n;
Before the angels he shall know His name confessed in heav'n.
Then onward from the hills of light, Our hearts with love aflame;
We'll vanquish all the hosts of night, In Jesus' conquering name.

Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.

Then at last go home to Thee,
Evermore Thy child to be.

<string>493 Fill My Cup, Lord
Richard Blanchard          Richard Blanchard
1
Like the woman at the well I was seeking
For things that could not satisfy:
And then I heard my Savior speaking:
"Draw from My well that never shall run dry."

Refrain
Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more;
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!

2
There are millions in this world who are craving
The pleasure earthly things afford;
But none can match the wondrous treasure
That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

3
So, my children, if the things this world gave you
Leave hungers that won't pass away,
My blessed Lord will come and save you,
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:

From every stormy wind that blows, From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat: 'Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

2
There is a place where Jesus sheds The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all besides more sweet; It is the blood-bought mercy seat.

3
There is a scene where spirits blend, Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet Around one common mercy seat.

4
There, there, on angel's wings we soar, And earthly cares molest no more,
And heaven comes down our souls to greet, And glory crowns the mercy seat.

5
Ah! whither should we flee for aid, When tempted, desolate, dismayed?
Or how the hosts of sin defeat, Had suffering saints no mercy seat?

As they journey homeward By that guiding star.

Throw Thy radiance o'er them, Guide them on their way;

'Neath Thy starlit banner, Jesus follows thee.
O'er the distant mountains To that heavenly home,
Where no sin nor sorrow Evermore shall come.

On the Rock of Ages founded, What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's wall surrounded, Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.

See the streams of living waters Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters, And all fear and want remove;
Who can faint when such a river Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver, Never fails from age to age.

3
Round each habitation hovering, See the cloud and fire appear
For a glory and a covering, Showing that the Lord is near;
Blest inhabitants of Zion, Washed in the Redeemer's blood;
Jesus, whom their souls rely on, Makes them kings and priests to God.

4
Savior, if of Zion's city I, through grace, a member am,
Let the world deride or pity, I will glory in Thy name;
Fading is the worldling's pleasure, All his boasted pomp and show;
Solid joys and lasting treasure None but Zion's children know.

Let me bow before Thee,
Know Thee and adore Thee.

Gladly we surrender
Earth's deceitful treasures,
Pride of life and sinful pleasures:
Gladly, Lord, we offer
Thine to be forever,
Soul and life and each endeavor.
Thou alone shall be known
Lord of all our being,
Life's true way decreeing.

<string>641 God in His Love for Us
Fred Pratt Green          H. Walford Davies
1
God in His love for us lent us this planet,
Gave it a purpose in time and in space:
Small as a spark from the fire of creation,
Cradle of life and the home of our race.

2
Thanks be to God for its bounty and beauty,
Life that sustains us in body and mind:
Plenty for all, if we learn how to share it,
Riches undreamed of to fathom and find.

3
Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;
Long has earth bowed to the terror of force;
Long have we wasted what others have need of,
Poisoned the fountain of life at its source.

4
Earth is the Lord's: it is ours to enjoy it,
Ours, as His stewards, to farm and defend.
From its pollution, misuse, and destruction,
Good Lord, deliver us, world without end! 
</string>

<string>61 God Is Here!
Fred Pratt Green          Cyril V. Taylor
1
God is here! as we His people meet to offer praise and prayer,
May we find in fuller measure what it is in Christ we share.
Here, as in the world around us, all our varied skills and arts
Wait the coming of the Spirit into open minds and hearts.

2
Here are symbols to remind us of our lifelong need of grace;
Here are table, font and pulpit; here the Word has central place.
Here in honesty of preaching, here in silence, as in speech,
Here in newness and renewal, God the Spirit comes to each.

3
Here our children find a welcome in the Shepherd's flock and fold.
Here, as bread and wine are taken Christ sustains us as of old.
Here the servants of the Servant seek in worship to explore
What it means in daily living to believe and to adore.

4
Lord of all, church and kingdom, in an age of change and doubt,
Keep us faithful to the gospel, help us work Your purpose out.
Here, in this day's dedication, all we have to give, receive,
We, who cannot live without You, we adore You! we believe! 
</string>

<string>349 God Is Love
James Quinn          Gregory Murray
Refrain
God is love, and where true love is
God Himself is there.

1
Here in Christ we gather, love of Christ our calling.
Christ, our love, is with us, gladness be His greeting.
Let us fear Him, yes, and love Him, God eternal.
Loving Him, let each love Christ in all his brethren.

2
When we Christians gather, members of one body,
Let there be in us no discord but one spirit.
Banished now be anger, strife, and every quarrel.
Christ, our God, be always present here among us.

3
Grant us love's fulfillment, joy with all the blessed,
When we see Your face, O Savior, in its glory.
Shine on us, O purest Light of all creation,
Be our bliss while endless ages sing Your praises.
</string>

<string>339 God Is My Strong Salvation
James Montgomery          J. Steurlein
1
God is my strong salvation,
What foe have I to fear?
In darkness and temptation,
My Light, my Help, is near:
Though hosts encamp around me,
Firm in the fight I stand;
What terror can confound me,
With God at my right hand?

2
Place on the Lord reliance;
My soul with courage wait;
His truth be thine affiance,
When faint and desolate.
His might thy heart shall strengthen,
His love thy joy increase;
Mercy thy days shall lengthen;
The Lord will give thee peace.
</string>

<string>22 God Is Our Song
Fred Pratt Green          Genevan Psalter
1
God is our Song, and every singer blest
Who praising Him finds energy and rest.
All who praise God with unaffected joy
Give back to us the widom we destroy,
Give back to us the widom we destroy.

2
God is our Song, for Jesus comes to save;
While praising Him we offer all we have.
New songs we sing, in ventures new unite,
When Jesus leads us upward into light,
When Jesus leads us upward into light.

3
This is the Song no conflict ever drowns;
Who praises God our human wrath disowns.
Love knows what rich complexities of sound
God builds upon a simple common ground,
God builds upon a simple common ground.

4
God is our Silence when no songs are sung,
When ecstasy or sorrow stills the tongue.
Glorious the faith which silently obeys
Until we find again the voice of praise,
Until we find again the voice of praise. 
</string>

<string>225 God Is Working His Purpose Out
Arthur C. Ainger          Martin Shaw
1
God is working His purpose out As year succeeds to year;
God is working His purpose out, And the time is drawing near;
Nearer and nearer draws the time, The time that shall surely be
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

2
From utmost east to utmost west, Where'er man's foot hath trod,
By the mouth of many messengers Goes forth the voice of God;
Give ear to me, ye continents, Ye isles, give ear to me,
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

3
March we forth in the strength of God, With the banner of Christ unfurled,
That the light of the glorious gospel of truth May shine thru-out the world:
Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin To set their captives free,
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

4
All we can do is nothing worth Unless God blesses the deed;
Vainly we hope for the harvest tide Till God gives life to the seed;
Yet nearer and nearer draws the time, The time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea. 
</string>

<string>107 God Moves in a Mysterious Way
William Cowper          Scottish Psalter
1
God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.

2
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your head.

3
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace;
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.

4
His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.

5
Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan His work in vain;
God is His own interpreter,
And He will make it plain. 
</string>

<string>607 God of Grace and God of Glory
Harry Emmerson Fosdick            Henry Purcell

God of grace and God of glory,
On Thy people pour Thy power;
Now fulfill Thy church's story,
Bring her bud to glorious flower.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
For the facing of this hour.

2
Lo, the hosts of evil round us
Scorn Thy Christ, assail His ways;
From the fears that long have bound us
Free our hearts to faith and praise.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
For the facing of this hour.

3
Cure Thy children's warring madness,
Bend our pride to Thy control;
Shame our wanton selfish gladness
Rich in goods and poor in soul.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
Lest we miss Thy kingdom's goal.

4
Set our feet on lofty places,
Gird our lives that they may be
Armored with all Christ-like graces
In the fight to set all free.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
That we fail not man nor Thee.

<string>645 God of Our Fathers
Daniel C. Roberts          George W. Warren
1
God of our fathers, whose almighty hand
Leads forth in beauty all the starry band
Of shining worlds in splendor through the skies
Our grateful songs before Thy throne arise.

2
Thy love divine hath led us in the past,
In this free land by Thee our lot is cast,
Be Thou our ruler, guardian, guide and stay,
Thy word our law, Thy paths our chosen way.

3
From war's alarms, from deadly pestilence,
Be Thy strong arm our ever sure defense;
Thy true religion in our hearts increase,
Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.

4
Refresh Thy people on their toilsome way,
Lead us from night to never ending day;
Fill all our lives with love and grace divine,
And glory, laud, and praise be ever Thine.

<string>84 God the Omnipotent
John Ellerton          Alexis Lwoff
1
God the Omnipotent! King, who ordainest
Great winds Thy clarions, the lightnings Thy sword;
Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,
Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

2
God the all merciful! earth hath forsaken
Thy precepts holy, and slighted Thy word;
Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;
Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

3
God the all righteous One! man hath defied Thee;
Yet to eternity standeth Thy word;
Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;
Prosper the right, O most merciful Lord.

4
So shall we render Thee thankful devotion,
For Thy deliverance from peril and sword,
Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,
"Thine is the power and the glory, O Lord."

<string>87 God Who Spoke in the Beginning
Fred Kaan          David McCarthy
1
God who spoke in the beginning,
Forming rock and shaping spar,
Set all life and growth in motion,
Earthly world and distant star;
He who calls the earth to order
Is the ground of what we are.

2
God who spoke thro' men and nations,
Thro' events long past and gone,
Showing still today His purpose,
Speaks supremely through His Son;
He who calls the earth to order
Gives His word and it is done.

3
God whose speech becomes incarnate
Christ is servant, Christ is Lord
Calls us to a life of service,
Heart and will to action stirred;
He who uses man's obedience
Has the first and final word.

Lean, weary one, upon His breast,
God will take care of you.

<string>47 God, Who Made the Earth and Heaven
Richard Whately          Welsh Melody
1
God, who made the earth and heaven, darkness and light:
You the day for work have given, for rest the night.
May Your angel guards defend us, slumber sweet Your mercy send us,
Holy dreams and hopes attend us all through the night.

2
And when morn again shall call us to run life's way,
May we still, what-e'er befall us, Your will obey.
From the pow'r of evil hide us, in the narrow pathway guide us,
Never be Your smile denied us all through the day.

3
Guard us waking, guard us sleeping, And, when we die,
May we in Your mighty keeping All peaceful lie.
When the trumpet call shall wake us, Then, O Lord, do not forsake us,
But to reign in glory take us with You on high.

4
Holy Father, throned in heaven, All holy Son,
Holy Spirit, freely given, Blest Three in One:
Grant us grace, we now implore You, till we lay our crowns before You
And in worthier strains adore You while ages run.

Catherine Cameron          Eurydice V. Osterman
1
God, who stretched the spangled heavens
Infinite in time and place,
Flung the suns in burning radiance
Through the silent fields of space:
We, Your children in Your likeness,
Share inventive powers with You;
Great Creator, still creating,
Show us what we yet may do.

2
We have ventured worlds undreamed of
Since the childhood of our race;
Known the ecstasy of winging
Through untraveled realms of space,
Probed the secrets of the atom,
Yielding unimagined power,
Facing us with life's destruction
Or our most triumphant hour.

3
As each far horizon beckons,
May it challenge us anew:
Children of creative purpose,
Serving others, honoring You.
May our dreams prove rich with promise;
Each endeavor well begun;
Great Creator, give us guidance
Till our goals and Yours are one.

<string>636 God, Whose Giving Knows No Ending
Robert L. Edwards          Charles H. H. Parry
1
God, whose giving knows no ending,
From Your rich and endless store:
Nature's wonder, Jesus' wisdom,
Costly cross, grave's shattered door.
Gifted by You, we turn to You,
Off'ring up Your-selves in praise:
Thankful song shall rise forever,
Gracious donor of our days.

2
Skills and time are ours for pressing
Toward the goals of Christ, Your Son:
All at peace in health and freedom,
Races joined, the church made one.
Now direct our daily labor,
Lest we strive for self alone:
Born with talents, make us servants
Fit to answer at Your throne.

3
Treasure, too, You have entrusted,
Gain through pow'rs Your grace conferred:
Ours to use for home and kindred,
And to spread the Gospel Word.
Open wide our hands in sharing,
As we heed Christ's ageless call.
Healing, teaching, and reclaiming,
Serving You by loving all.

And leaning upon Him, sweet, sweet is my rest,
No harm can befall me, safe, safe shall I be,
I'll cling to Him ever, so precious is He.

Happy light is flowing, Bountiful and free;
Everything rejoices in the mellow rays;
Earth's ten thousand voices swell the psalm of praise.

Lord, upon our blindness Thy pure radiance pour;
For Thy loving kindness we would love Thee more;
And when clouds are drifting dark across the sky,
Then, the veil uplifting, Father, be Thou nigh.

We will never doubt Thee, Tho' Thou veil Thy light;
Life is dark without Thee, Death with Thee is bright.
Light of light, shine o'er us on our pilgrim way,
Go Thou still before us to the endless day.

Gracious Father, guard Thy children
From the foe's destructive power;
Save, O save them, Lord, from falling
In this dark and trying hour.

All our graces must be tried;
But Thy word illumes our pathway,
And in God we still confide.

We are in the time of waiting;
Soon we shall behold our Lord,
Wafted far away from sorrow,
To receive our rich reward.
Keep us, Lord, till Thine appearing,
Pure, unspotted from the world;
Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us
Till Thy banner is unfurled.

With what joyful exultation
Shall the saints Thy banner see,
When the Lord for whom we've waited
Shall proclaim the jubilee!
Freedom from this world's pollutions;
Freedom from all sin and pain;
Freedom from the wiles of Satan,
And from death's destructive reign.

Precious all that now reminds us

How to use this house of prayer:

Of a world which must be won!

Loud and long the Master calleth, Rich reward He offers free;
Who will answer, gladly saying, "Here am I, O Lord, send me"?

If you cannot cross the ocean And the heathen lands explore,
You can find the heathen nearer, You can help them at your door;
If you cannot speak like angels, If you cannot preach like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus, You can say He died for all.

3
If you cannot be the watchman, Standing high on Zion's wall,
Pointing out the path to heaven, Offering life and peace to all;
With your prayers and with your bounties You can do what Heaven demands,
You can be like faithful Aaron, Holding up the prophet's hands.

4
While the souls of men are dying, And the Master calls for you,
Let none hear you idly saying, "There is nothing I can do!"
Gladly take the task He gives you, Let His work your pleasure be;
Answer quickly when He calleth, "Here am I, O Lord, send me."

Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountain wild and high,
Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee,
"Go, find My sheep where'er they be."

O'er the waters soft and clear;

Soft it breaks upon the ear.

Amen.

Adelaide Pollard          George C. Stebbins

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.
Mold me and make me after Thy will,
while I am waiting, yielded and still.

2
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Search me and try me, Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me I pray!
Power, all power, surely is Thine!

4
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Hold o'er my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me!

<string>520 He Hideth My Soul
Fanny J. Crosby          William J. Kirkpatrick
1
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me,
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

Refrain
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.

2
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away,
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

3
With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, Oh, glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine.

4
When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high.

<string>537 He Leadeth Me
J. H. Gilmore          William B. Bradbury
1
He leadeth me! O blessed thought!
O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
What-e'er I do, where'er I be,
Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

Refrain
He leadeth me, He leadeth me,
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.

2
Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
By waters still, o'er troubled sea,
Still 'tis His hand that leadeth me!

3
Lord, I would clasp my hand in Thine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine;
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since 'tis my God that leadeth me.

4
And when my task on earth is done,
When, by Thy grace, the victory's won,
E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

I serve a risen Savior, He's in the world today;
I know that He is living, whatever men may say;
I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer
And just the time I need Him He's always near.

Refrain
He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!
He walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way.
He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!
You ask me how I know He lives?
He lives within my heart.

In all the world around me I see His loving care,
And tho' my heart grows weary I never will despair;
I know that He is leading thru all the stormy blast,
The day of His appearing will come at last.

Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian, lift up your voice and sing,
Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King!
The hope of all who seek Him, the help of all who find,
None other is so loving, so good and kind.

Take them to Your home at last!

<string>594 Heir of the Kingdom
Anon.          Lowell Mason
1
Heir of the kingdom, O why dost thou slumber?
Why art thou sleeping so near thy blest home?
Wake thee, arouse thee, and gird on thine armor,
Speed, for the moments are hurrying on.

2
Heir of the kingdom, say, why dost thou linger?
How canst thou tarry in sight of the prize?
Up, and adorn thee, the Savior is coming;
Haste to receive Him descending the skies.

3
Earth's mighty nations, in strife and commotion,
Tremble with terror, and sink in dismay;
Listen, 'tis nought but the chariot's loud rumbling;
Heir of the kingdom, no longer delay.

4
Stay not, O stay not for earth's vain allurements!
See how its glory is passing away;
Break the strong fetters the foe hath bound o'er thee;
Heir of the kingdom, turn, turn thee away.

5
Keep the eye single, the head upward lifted;
Watch for the glory of earth's coming King;
Lo! o'er the mountaintops light is now breaking;
Heirs of the kingdom, rejoice ye and sing.

<string>525 Hiding in Thee
William O. Cushing          Ira D. Sankey
1
O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine, would I be;
Thou blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee.

Refrain
Hiding in Thee, Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest "Rock of Ages,"
I'm hiding in Thee.

2
In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation casts o'er me its power;
In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,
Thou blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee.

3
How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.

<string>625 Higher Ground
Johnson Oatman          Charles H. Gabriel
1
I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as I'm onward bound,
"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."

Refrain
Lord, lift me up, and I shall stand
By faith, on heaven's table-land,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

2
My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

3
I want to live above the world,
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.

4
I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till heaven I've found,
"Lord, lead me on to higher ground."

<string>His Eye Is On the Sparrow

1
Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heav'n and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant Friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

Refrain
I sing because I'm happy, I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

2
"Let not your heart be troubled," His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

3
Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

F. E. Belden          F. E. Belden

Sweet promise is given to all who believe
"Behold I come quickly, Mine own to receive;
Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;
Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait."

Refrain
"Hold fast till I come;" sweet promise of heaven
"The kingdom restored, to you shall be given."
"Come, enter My joy, sit down on My throne;
Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come."

2
We'll "watch unto prayer" with lamps burning bright;
He comes to all others a "thief in the night."
We know He is near, but know not the day
As spring shows that summer is not far away.

3
Yes! this is our hope, 'tis built on His word
The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;
Of promises all, it stands as the sum:
"Behold I come quickly; hold fast till I come."

While in essence only one,
Undivided God we claim You;

Sing and pray at Jesus' feet.

Asking Him for saving grace,
Also vict'ry in the race,
And to help us by His pow'r,
To keep holy every hour.

<string>589 Holy Spirit, Gracious Guest
Christopher Wordsworth          Grayston Ives
1
Holy Spirit, gracious guest, Hear and grant our heart's request
For that gift supreme and best: Holy heav'nly love.

2
Faith that mountains could remove, Tongues of earth or heaven above,
Knowledge, all things, empty prove If I have no love.

3
Though I as a martyr bleed, Give my goods the poor to feed,
All is vain if love I need: Therefore give me love.

4
Love is kind and suffers long, Love is pure and thinks no wrong,
Love than death itself more strong: Therefore give us love.

5
Prophecy will fade away, Melting in the light of day;
Love will ever with us stay: Therefore give us love.

6
Faith and hope and love we see Joining hand in hand agree
But the greatest of the three, And the best is love.

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!
God in three persons, blessed Trinity!

2
Holy, holy, holy! Angels adore Thee,
Casting down their bright crowns around the glassy sea;
Thousands and ten thousands worship low before Thee,
Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.

3
Holy, holy, holy! though darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of man Thy great glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power, in love, and purity.

All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth and sky and sea;
Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!

<string>425 Holy, Holy, Is What the Angels Sing
Johnson Oatman          John R. Sweney
1
There is singing up in heaven such as we have never known,
Where the angels sing the praises of the Lamb upon the throne;
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful and their voices always clear,
O that we might be more like them while we serve the Master here!

Refrain
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make the courts of heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story, they will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys that our salvation brings.

2
But I hear another anthem, blending voices clear and strong,
"Unto Him who hath redeemed us and hath bought us," is the song;
We have come thro' tribulations to this land so fair and bright,
In the fountain freely flowing He hath made our garments white.

3
Then the angels stand and listen, for they cannot join that song,
Like the sound of many waters, by that happy, blood-washed throng;
For they sing about great trials, battles fought and vict'ries won,
And they praise their great Redeemer, who hath said to them, "Well done."

4
So, although I'm not an angel, yet I know that over there
I will join a blessed chorus that the angels cannot share;
I will sing about my Savior, who upon dark Calvary
Freely pardoned my transgressions, died to set a sinner free.

Come, O come and fill me now.

Refrain
Fill me now, fill me now,

Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.

2
Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,
Though I cannot tell Thee how;
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee;
Come, O come and fill me now.

3
I am weakness, full of weakness;
At Thy sacred feet I bow;
Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
Fill with love, and fill me now.

4
Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;
Bathe, O, bathe my heart and brow;
Thou art comforting and saving,
Thou art sweetly filling now.

Isaac Watts          Williams Psalmody
1
How beauteous are their feet
Who stand on Zion's hill;
Who bring salvation on their tongues,
And words of peace reveal!

2
How charming is their voice,
So sweet the tidings are:
"Zion, behold thy Savior King;
He reigns and triumphs here!"

3
How happy are our ears,
That hear the joyful sound
Which kings and prophets waited for,
And sought, but never found!

4
How blessed are our eyes,
That see this heavenly light;
Prophets and kings desired it long,
But died without the sight!

5
The watchmen join their voice,
And tuneful notes employ;
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
And deserts learn the joy.

How cheering is the Christian's hope,

It points us to a land of rest,
Where saints with Christ will reign;
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
And never part again.
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
And never part again.

<string>439 How Far From Home?
Annie R. Smith          Arranged
1
How far from? I asked, as on I bent my steps the watchman spake:
"The long, dark night is almost gone, The morning soon will break.
Then weep no more, but speed thy flight, With Hope's bright star thy guiding ray,
Till thou shalt reach the realms of light, In everlasting day."

2
I asked the warrior on the field; This was his soul-inspiring song:
"With courage, bold, the sword I'll wield, The battle is not long.
Then weep no more, but well endure The conflict, till thy work is done;
For this we know, the prize is sure, When victory is won."

3
I asked again; earth, sea, and sun Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:
"Time's wasting sands are nearly run, Eternity is nigh.
Then weep no more with warning tones, Portentous signs are thickening round,
The whole creation, waiting, groans, To hear the trumpet sound."

4
Not far from home! O blessed thought! The traveler's lonely heart to cheer;
Which oft a healing balm has brought, And dried the mourner's tear.
Then weep no more, since we shall meet Where weary footsteps never roam
Our trails past, our joys complete, Safe in our Father's home.

Rippon's A Selection of Hymns          Melvin West
1
How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
To you who for refuge to Jesus hath fled?

2
"Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand."

3
"When thro' the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress."

4
"When thro' fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine."

5
"The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for respose,
I will not, I will not desert to His foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"

O Lord my God! when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made

Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed,

Refrain
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee;
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

2
When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;

3
And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin;

4
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!

Scottish Psalter          Harry T. Burleigh

How pleasant, Lord, they be!

2
My thirsty soul longs ardently,
Yea, faints Thy courts to see;
My very heart and flesh cry out,
O living God, for Thee.

3
Behold the sparrow findeth out
A house where-in to rest;
The swallow also, for herself
Provided hath a nest.

4
Ev'n Thine own altars, where she safe
Her young ones forth may bring,
O Thou, almighty Lord of hosts,
Who art my God and King.

Blest are they in Thy house that dwell,
They ever give Thee praise.
Blest is the man whose strength Thou art,
In whose heart are Thy ways.

As he wanders in exile from home!
Soon, soon will the Savior in glory appear,
And soon will the kingdom come.

Refrain
He's coming, coming, coming soon I know,
Coming back to this earth again;
And the weary pilgrims will to glory go,
When the Savior comes to reign.

The mossy old graves where the pilgrims sleep
Shall be open as wide as before,
And the millions that sleep in the mighty deep
Shall live on this earth once more.

3
There we'll meet ne'er to part in our happy
Eden home, Sweet songs of redemption we'll sing;
From the north, from the south, all the ransomed shall come,
And worship our heavenly King.

4
Hallelujah, Amen! Hallelujah again!
Soon, if faithful, we all shall be there;
O, be watchful, be hopeful, be joyful till then,
And a crown of bright glory we'll wear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary, rest.

Dear name, the rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place,
My never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace.

My Prophet, Priest, and King!
My Lord, my life, my way, my end!
Accept the praise I bring.

Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I'll praise Thee as I ought.

<string>I Am So Glad That Our Father

1
I am so glad that our Father in heav'n
Tells of His love in the Book He has giv'n;
Wonderful things in the Bible I see,
This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

Refrain
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

2
Tho I forget Him and wander away,
Still He doth love me wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving arms would I flee
When I remember that Jesus loves me.

3
O if there's only one song I can sing
When in His beauty I see the great King,
This shall my song in eternity be,
"O what a wonder, that Jesus loves me!"

<string>535 I Am Trusting Thee, Lord Jesus
Frances R. Havergal          Ethelbert W. Bullinger
1
I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
Trusting only Thee;
Trusting Thee for full salvation,
Great and free.

2
I am trusting Thee for pardon;
At Thy feet I bow;
For Thy grace and tender mercy,
Trusting now.	

3
I am trusting Thee to guide me;
Thou alone shalt lead;
Every day and hour supplying
All my need.

4
I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
Never let me fall;
I am trusting Thee forever,
And for all.

<string>255 I Cannot Tell Why
W. Y. Fullerton          John Barnard
1
I cannot tell why He whom angels worship
Should set His love upon the souls of men,
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers,
To bring them back, they know not how nor when.
But this I know, that He was born of Mary
When Bethlehem's manger was His only home,
And that He lived at Nazareth and labored;
And so the Savior, Savior of the world, has come.

2
I cannot tell how silently He suffered
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,
Nor how His heart upon the cross was broken,
The crown of pain to three and thirty years.
But this I know He heals the broken hearted
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear,
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden;
For still the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.

3
I cannot tell how He will win the nations,
How He will claim His earthly heritage,
How satisfy the needs and aspirations
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory,
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,
And some glad day His sun will shine in splendor
When He the Savior, Savior, of the world, is known.

4
I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,
When at His biding every storm is stilled,
Or who can say how great the jubilation
When all our hearts with love for Him are filled.
But this I know the skies shall sound His praises,
Ten thousand thousand human voices sing,
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth will answer,
At last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King!

<string>400 I Come With Joy
Brian A. Wren          Charles G. Frischmann
1
I come with joy to meet my Lord,
Forgiven, loved and free,
In awe and wonder to recall
His life laid down for me,
His life laid down for me.

2
I come with Christians far and near
To find, as all are fed,
Our true community of love
In Christ's communion bread,
In Christ's communion bread.

3
As Christ breaks bread for us to share
Each proud division ends.
That love that made us makes us one,
And strangers now are friends,
And strangers now are friends.

4
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.
His presence always near,
Is in such friendship better known:
We see and praise Him here,
We see and praise Him here.

5
Together met, together bound,
We'll go our different ways,
And as His people in the world,
We'll live and speak His praise,
We'll live and speak His praise.

<string>486 I Do Believe
Charles Wesley          Arranged
1
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee; No other help I know;
If Thou withdraw Thyself from me, Ah, wither shall I go?

2
On Thy dear Son I now believe, O let me feel Thy power;
And all my varied wants relieve, In this accepted hour.

3
Author of faith! To Thee I lift My weary, longing eyes;
O let me now receive that gift; My soul without it dies.

4
Surely Thou canst not let me die; O speak, and I shall live;
And here I will unwearied lie, Till Thou Thy Spirit give.

5
How would my fainting soul rejoice Could I but see Thy face!
Now let me hear Thy quickening voice, And taste Thy pardoning grace.

6
I do believe, I now believe That Jesus died for me,
And that He shed His precious blood From sin to set me free.

Frances RidleyHavergal          J. E. White

My precious blood I shed,
That thou might'st ransom be,
And quickened from the dead;

What hast thou given for Me?
I gave, I gave My life for thee,
What hast thou given for Me?

2
My Father's house of light,
My glory circled throne,
I left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone;
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for Me?
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for Me?

3
I suffered much for thee,
More than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue thee from hell;
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for Me?
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for Me?

That flowed on Calvary.

Though coming weak and vile,

'Tis Jesus calls me on
To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
For earth and heaven above.

All hail! the gift of Christ, our Lord,
Our Strength and Righteousness.

Mrs Elvina M. Hall          John T. Grape
1
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"Come unto Me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast."
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary and worn and sad;
I found in Him a resting place,
And He has made me glad.

2
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"Behold, I freely give
The living water; thirsty one,
Stoop down and drink and live."
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quench'd, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.

3
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"I am this dark world's light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright."
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my star, my sun;
And in that light of life I'll walk,
Till trav'ling days are done.

<string>I Know Who Holds Tomorrow

1
I don't know about tomorrow,
I just live from day to day.
I don't borrow from it's sunshine,
For it's skies may turn to gray.
I don't worry o're the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
And today I'll walk beside Him,
For He knows what is ahead.

Refrain
Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand;
But I know who holds tomorrow,
And I know who holds my hand.

2
Every step is getting brighter
as the golden stairs I climb;
Every burden's getting lighter,
Every cloud is silver lined.
There the sun is always shining,
There no tear will dim the eye;
At the ending of the rainbow,
Where the mountains touch the sky.

3
I don't know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty;
But the one who feeds the sparrow,
Is the one who stands by me.
And the path that be my portion,
May be through the flame or flood,
But His presence goes before me,
And I'm covered with His blood.

Daniel W. Whittle          James McGranahan
1
I know not why God's wondrous grace To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love Redeemed me for His own.

Refrain
But "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that His is able
To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day."

2
I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His word Wrought peace within my heart.

3
I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the word, Creating faith in Him.

4
I know not when my Lord may come, At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I walk the vale with Him, Or meet Him in the air.

White in His blood most precious,
Till not a stain remains,

I lay my wants on Jesus,
All fullness dwells in Him;
He healeth my diseases,
He doth my soul redeem,
He doth my soul redeem.

I long to be like Jesus,
Meek, loving, lowly, mild;
I long to be like Jesus,
The Father's holy child,
The Father's holy child.

Amid the heav'nly throng,
To sing with them His praises,
And learn the angels' song.

While rivers of pleasure my spirit do cheer.

What seems each time I tell it, More wonderfully sweet.

The message of salvation From God's own holy word.

The brightest glories earth can yield,
And brighter bliss of heaven.

Makes of my troubles quickly an end.

Over the world the vict'ry to win.

<string>441 I Saw One Weary
Annie R. Smith          George Coles
1
I saw one weary, sad, and torn, With eager steps press on the way,
Who long the hallowed cross had born, Still looking for the promised day;
While many a line of grief and care, Upon his brow was furrowed there;
I asked what buoyed his spirits up, "O this!" said he "the blessed hope."

2
And one I saw, with sword and shield, Who boldly braved the world's cold frown,
And fought, unyielding, on the field, To win an everlasting crown.
Though worn with toil, oppressed by foes, No murmur from his heart arose;
I asked what buoyed his spirits up, "O this!" said he "the blessed hope."

3
And there was one who left behind The cherished friends of early years,
And honor, pleasure, wealth resigned, To tread the path bedewed with tears.
Through trials deep and conflict sore, Yet still a smile of joy he wore;
I asked what buoyed his spirits up, "O this!" said he "the blessed hope."

4
While pilgrims here we journey on In this dark vale of sin and gloom,
Through tribulation, hate, and scorn, Or through the portals of the tomb,
Till our returning King shall come To take His exile captives home,
O! what can buoy the spirits up? 'Tis this alone the blessed hope.

And forever endless praises sing;
'Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King some day.

2
In the land of song, in the glory throng,
Where there never comes a night,
With my Lord once slain I shall ever reign
In the glory land of light.

3
I shall see the King, all my tributes bring,
And shall look upon His face;
Then my song shall be how He ransomed me
And has kept me by His grace.

Isaac Watts          G. F. Root
1
I sing the mighty power of God,
That made the mountains rise,
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
And built the lofty skies.
I sing the wisdom that ordained
The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at His command,
And all the stars obey.

2
I sing the goodness of the Lord,
That filled the earth with food,
He formed the creatures with His word,
And then pronounced them good.
Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed,
Where'er I turn my eye!
If I survey the ground I tread,
Or gaze upon the sky!

3
There's not a plant or flower below,
But makes Thy glories known,
And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
By order from Thy throne.
Creatures that borrow life from Thee
Are subject to Thy care;
There's not a place where we can flee
But God is present there.

Glory, glory, to His name!

Jemima Luke          Ralph Vaughan Williams

I think when I read that sweet story of old,
When Jesus was here among men,
How He called little children as lambs to His fold,
I should like to have been with Him then.

2
I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,
That His arm had been thrown around me,
And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,
"Let the little ones come unto Me."

3
I long for the joy of that glorious time,
The sweetest and brightest and best,
When the dear little children of every clime
Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.

Sir Cecil Spring-Rice          Gustav Holst
1
I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,
Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love:
The love that asks the reason, the love that stands the test,
That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.

2
And there's another country, I've heard of long ago,
Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;
We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;
And one by one and fervently we pray for her increase,
And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.

4
Though Thou leadest me through affliction, Poor, forsaken though I be;

Or be held in sin's dread sway!

This world affords today.

I'd rather have Jesus than world-wide fame;

He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;

I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead:

To give you hope and strength within.
For those who trust God's changeless love
Build on the rock that will not move.

2
What gain is there in futile weeping,
In helpless anger and distress?
If you are in His care and keeping,
In sorrow will He love you less?
For He who took for you a cross
Will bring you safe through every loss.

3
In patient trust await His leisure
In cheerful hope, with heart content
To take what-e'er your Father's pleasure
And all discerning love have sent;
Doubt not your inmost wants are known
To Him who chose you for His own.

4
Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,
Offer your service faithfully,
And trust His word; though undeserving,
You'll find His promise true to be.
God never will forsake in need
The soul that trusts in Him indeed.

<string>573 I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go
Mary Brown          Carrie E. Rounsefell
1
It may not be on the mountain's height,
Or over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle's front
My Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still, small voice He calls
To paths I do not know,
I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I'll go where You want me to go.

Refrain
I'll go where You want me to go, dear Lord,
O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what You want me to say, dear Lord,
I'll be what You want me to be.

2
Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand'rer whom I should seek.
O Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide,
Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I'll say what You want me to say.

3
There's surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth's harvest fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life's short day
For Jesus, the Crucified.
So, trusting my all unto Thy care,
I know Thou lovest me!
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what You want me to be.

Mary S. B. Dana          Italian air

I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger;
I can tarry, I can tarry but a night;
Do not detain me, for I am going
To where the fountains are ever flowing.

Refrain
I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger;
I can tarry, I can tarry but a night.

2
There the glory is ever shining!
O, my longing heart, my longing heart is there;
Here in this country so dark and dreary,
I long have wandered forlorn and weary.

3
There's the city to which I journey;
My Redeemer, my Redeemer is its light!
There is no sorrow, nor any sighing,
Nor any tears there, or any dying.

Thomas R. Taylor          Lowell Mason
1
I'm but a stranger here,
Heaven is my home;
Earth is a desert drear,
Heaven is my home.
Danger and sorrow stand
Round me on every hand;
Heaven is my Fatherland,
Heaven is my home.

2
What though the tempest rage,
Heaven is my home;
Short is my pilgrimage,
Heaven is my home;
Time's cold and wintry blast
Soon will be over past;
I shall reach home at last,
Heaven is my home.

3
There at my Savior's side
Heaven is my home;
I shall be glorified,
Heaven is my home;
There'll be the good and blest,
Those I love most and best;
There, too, I soon shall rest,
Heaven is my home.

William Hunter          William McDonald

My heav'nly home is bright and fair,
Nor pain nor death can enter there;

That heav'nly mansion shall me mine.

Refrain
I'm going home, I'm going home,
I'm going home to die no more;
To die no more; to die no more
I'm going home to die no more.

2
My Father's house is built on high,
Far, far above the starry sky;
When from this earthly prison free,
That heav'nly mansion mine shall be.

3
Let others seek a home below,
Which flames devour or waves o'er flow;
Be mine a happier lot to own
A heav'nly mansion near the throne.

<string>455 Immortal Love, Forever Full
John Greenlead Whittier          William V. Wallace
1
Immortal Love, forever full, Forever flowing free,
Forever shared, forever whole, A never ebbing sea!

2
We may not climb the heavenly steeps To bring the Lord Christ down;
In vain we search the lowest deeps, For Him no depths can drown.

3
But warm, sweet, tender, even yet A present help is He;
And faith has still its Olivet, And love its Galilee.

4
The healing of His seamless dress Is by our beds of pain;
We touch Him in life's throng and press, And we are whole again.

5
Through Him the first fond prayers are said, Our lips of childhood frame;
The last low whispers of our dead Are burdened with His name.

6
O Lord and Master of us all: Whate'er our names or sign,
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call, We test our lives by Thine!

Walter Chalmers Smith          Welsh Medley
1
Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.

2
Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;
Thy justice like mountains high soaring above
Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

3
To all life Thou givest to both great and small;
In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
We blossom and flourish, like leaves on the tree,
Then wither and perish; but naught changeth Thee.

4
Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,
Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;
All laud we would render: O help us to see
'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee.

Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way,
In a little while we're going home;
For the night will end in the everlasting day,
In a little while we're going home.

Refrain
In a little while, In a little while,
We shall cross the billow's foam;
We shall meet at last, When the stormy winds are past,
In a little while we're going home.

We will do the work that our hands may find to do,
In a little while we're going home;
And the grace of God will our daily strength renew,
In a little while we're going home.

3
We will smooth the path for some weary, wayworn feet,
In a little while we're going home;
And may loving hearts spread around an influence sweet!
In a little while we're going home.

4
There's a rest beyond, there's relief from every care,
In a little while we're going home;
And no tears shall fall in that city bright and fair,
In a little while we're going home.

In Him shall true hearts everywhere
Their high communion find;

Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,
What-e'er your race may be.

In Christ now meet both east and west,
In Him meet south and north;
All Christly souls are one in Him
Throughout the whole wide earth.

<string>513 In Heavenly Love Abiding
Anna Waring	David Evans

1
In heavenly love abiding, No change my heart shall fear;
And safe is such confiding, For nothing changes here.
The storm may roar without me, My heart may low be laid;
But God is round about me, And can I be dismayed?

2
Wherever He may guide me, No want shall turn me back;
My Shepherd is beside me, And nothing can I lack.
His wisdom ever waketh, His sight is never dim;
He knows the way He taketh, And I will walk with Him.

3
Green pastures are before me, Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be o'er me, Where darkest clouds have been.
My hope I cannot measure, My path to life is free;
My Savior has my treasure, And He will walk with me.

In imitation, Lord, of Thee,
This solemn service we repeat;
For Thine example full of grace,

Renew each sacred spark of love,
And vitalize the holy flame;

While this we do in Jesus' name.

Our great example Thou shalt be,
In washing Thy disciples feet;
And as we follow Thy command,
Make Thou our fellowship complete.

All things hateful to Thy mind.

May we loyal to Him be;
Try to please Him every day,
In our work and in our play.
Then we truthfully can sing,
We are children of the King.

<string>126 In the Bleak Midwinter
Christina Rossetti          Wayne Hooper 
1
In the bleak midwinter
Frosty wind made moan;
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter,
Long ago.

2
Angels and archangels
May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air:
But His mother only
In her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved
With a kiss.

3
What can I give Him,
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb;
If I were a wise man
I would do my part;
Yet what can I give Him?
Give my heart.

<string>237 In the Cross of Christ I Glory
John Bowring          Ithamar Conkey 
1
In the cross of Christ I glory,
Towering o'er the wrecks of time;
All the light of sacred story
Gathers round its head sublime.

2
When the woes of life o'er-take me,
Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
Never shall the cross forsake me;
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

3
When the sun of bliss is beaming
Light and love upon my way,
From the cross the radiance streaming
Adds new luster to the day.

4
Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
By the cross are sanctified;
Peace is there that knows no measure,
Joys that through all time abide.

<string>487 In the Garden
C. Austin Miles          C. Austin Miles
1
I come to the garden alone,
While the dew is still on the roses;
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,
The Son of God discloses.

Refrain
And He walks with me,
And He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.

2
He speaks, and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing.

3
I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be falling,
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe,
His voice to me is calling.

<string>577 In the Heart of Jesus
Alice Pugh          C. H. Forrest
1
In the heart of Jesus there is love for you,
Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;
Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,
When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?

2
In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you,
Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;
Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,
Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought?

3
In the field of Jesus there is work for you;
Such as even angels might rejoice to do;
Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand,
While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?

4
In the home of Jesus there's a place for you;
Glorious, bright, and joyous, calm and peaceful, too;
Why then, like a wanderer, roam with weary pace,
If the home of Jesus holds for you a place? 
</string>

<string>491 In the Hour of Trial
James Montgomery          Spencer Lane
1
In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
When Thou see'st me waver, with a look recall,
Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.

2
With forbidden pleasures, would this vain world charm;
Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;
Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,
Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.

3
Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil, and woe,
Or should pain attend me on my path below,
Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see;
Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.

Edith M. Gellibrand Reed          Polish Coral Melody

Infant holy, infant lowly,
For His bed a cattle stall;
Oxen lowing, little knowing
Christ the babe is Lord of all;
Swift are winging angels singing,
Noels ringing, tidings bringing,
Christ the babe is Lord of all,
Christ the babe is Lord of all.

2
Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping
Vigil till the morning new;
Saw the glory, heard the story,
Tidings of the gospel true;
Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow,
Praises voicing greet the morrow,
Christ the babe was born for you,
Christ the babe was born for you.

Brian Wren          Peter Cutts
1
Is this a day of new beginnings,
Time to remember and move on,
Time to believe what love is bringing,
Laying to rest the pain that's gone?

2
How can the seasons of a planet
Mindlessly spinning round its sun
With just a human name and number
Say that some new thing has begun?

3
Yet thro' the life and death of Jesus
Love's mighty Spirit, now as then,
Can make for us a world of difference
As faith and hope are born again.

4
Then let us, with the Spirit's daring,
Step from the past and leave behind
Its disappointment, guilt, and grieving,
Seeking new paths, and sure to find.

5
Christ is alive, and goes before us
To show and share what love can do.
This is a day of new beginnings;
Our God is making all things new.

<string>130 It Came Upon the Midnight Clear
Edmund H. Sears          Richard S. Willis
1
It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
"Peace on the earth, good will to men
From heaven's all gracious King;"
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

2
Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

3
And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Refrain
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

2
My sin, O, the joy of this glorious thought;
My sin, not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

3
And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,
"Even so," it is well with my soul.

1
It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,
When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking,
That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory
To receive from the world His own.

Refrain
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song?
Christ returneth, Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Amen, Hallelujah! Amen.

2
It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,
It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight
Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
When Jesus receives His own.

3
O joy! O delight! should we go without dying,
No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying,
Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,
When Jesus receives His own.

My Father is omnipotent
And that you can't deny;

Refrain
It took a miracle to put the stars in place;
It took a miracle to hang the world in space.
But when He saved my soul,
Cleansed and made me whole,
It took a miracle of love and grace!

2
Though here His glory has been shown,
We still can't fully see
The wonders of His might, His throne;
'Twill take eternity.

And wisdom all way through;
And every little bird and flower

And 'round my heart still closely twine Those ties which nought can sever,
For I am His, and He is mine, Forever and forever.

2
I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! He bled, He died to save me;
And not alone the gift of life, But His own self He gave me.
Nought that I have my own I call, I hold it for the Giver;
My heart, my strength, my life my all, Are His, and His forever.

3
I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! All power to Him is given;
To guard me on my upward course, And bring me safe to heaven.
The eternal glories gleam afar, To nerve my faint endeavor;
So now to watch, to work, to war, And then to rest forever.

4
I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! So kind, and true, and tender,
So wise a counselor and guide, So mighty a defender.
From Him, who loveth me so well, What power my soul can sever?
Shall life or death, or earth, or hell? No; I am His forever.

Jerusalem the golden, With milk and honey blest,
Beneath thy contemplation Sink heart and voice oppressed.
I know not, O I know not What holy joys are there;
What radiancy of glory, What bliss beyond compare.

They stand, those halls of Zion, All jubilant with song,
And bright with many an angel, And all the martyr throng.
The Prince is ever in them, The daylight is serene;
The pastures of the blessed Are deck in glorious sheen.

There is the throne of David, And there, from care released,
The shout of them that triumph, The song of them that feast;
And they who, with their Leader, Have conquered in the fight,
Forever and forever Are clad in robes of white.

Of our life's wild, restless sea;
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
Saying, "Christian, follow Me!"

2
Jesus calls us from the worship
Of the vain world's golden store,
From each idol that would keep us,
Saying, "Christian, love Me more!"

In our joys and in our sorrows,
Days of toil and hours of ease,
Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,
"Christian, love Me more than these!"

Jesus calls us! By Thy mercies,

Give our hearts to Thy obedience,
Serve and love Thee best of all.

And sup in memory of the death

2
We take the bread and wine

To feast on Thee by faith.

3
Faith eats the bread of life,
And drinks the living wine;
It looks beyond this scene of strife
Unites us to the Vine.

4
Soon shall the night be gone,
Our Lord will come again;
The marriage supper of the Lamb
Will usher in His reign.

Beautiful life with such a Friend, Beautiful life that has no end;
Eternal life, eternal joy, He's my Friend.

They are weak but He is strong

I hear the Savior say,
"Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."

He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots,
And melt the heart of stone.

3
Since nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim,
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb.

4
And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete,
I'll lay my trophies down,
All down at Jesus' feet.

By His death and endless life, Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

Give the winds a mighty voice, Jesus saves, Jesus saves;
Let the nations now rejoice, Jesus saves, Jesus saves;
Shout salvation full and free, Highest hills and deepest caves,

Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Does its successive journeys run;

Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name.

The pris'ners leap to lose their chains;
The weary find eternal rest,
And all who suffer want are blest.

Let every creature rise and bring
Honors peculiar to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud amen.

<string>325 Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken
Henry F. Lyte          Hubert P. Main
1
Jesus, I my cross have taken, all to leave and follow Thee.
All things else I have forsaken, Thou from hence my all shalt be.
Perish every fond ambition, all I've sought or hoped or known.
Yet how rich is my condition, while I prove the Lord my own.

2
Let the world despise and leave me, they have left my Savior, too.
Human hearts and looks deceive me; Thou art faithful, Thou art true.
O, 'tis not in grief to harm me, while Thy love is left to me;
O, 'twere not in joy to charm me, If that love be hid from me.

3
Soul, then know thy full salvation; rise o'er sin, and fear, and care;
Joy to find in every station something still to do or bear:
Think what Spirit dwells within thee; Think what Father's smiles are thine;
Think that Jesus died to win thee, child of Heaven, canst thou repine?

4
Haste thee on from grace to glory, armed by faith, and winged by prayer,
Heaven's eternal day's before thee, God's own hand shall guide thee there.
Soon shall close thy earthly mission, soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;
Hope soon change to glad fruition, faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

Safe into the haven guide, O receive my soul at last!

Plenteous grace with Thee is found. Grace to pardon all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound, Make and keep me pure within;

When Thou sayest to them, "Be still."

And the fearful breakers roar
'Twixt me and the peaceful rest,
Then, while leaning on Thy breast,
May I hear Thee say to me,
"Fear not, I will pilot thee."

Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept;

Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me like Mary, thru the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee;
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

4
May I be willing, Lord, to bear
Daily my cross for Thee;
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Lead on, O King Eternal,
The day of march has come;
Henceforth in fields of conquest
Thy tents shall be our home;
Through days of preparation
Thy grace has made us strong;
And now, O King Eternal,
We lift our battle song.

And holiness shall whisper
The sweet Amen of peace.

Nor roll of stirring drums,
With deeds of love and mercy,
The heavenly kingdom comes.

Lead on, O King Eternal,
We follow, not with fears,
For gladness breaks like morning
Where'er Thy face appears;
Thy cross is lifted o'er us;
We journey in its light;
The crown awaits the conquest;
Lead on, O God of might.

Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving
To God the Creator triumphantly raise,
Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us,
Who guideth us on to the end of our days.
His banners are o'er us, His light goes before us,
A pillar of fire shining forth in the night,
'Til shadows have vanished and darkness is banished,
As forward we travel from light into light.

His law He enforces: the stars in their courses,
The sun in His orbit, obediently shine;
The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,
The deeps of the ocean proclaim Him divine,
We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,
With glad adoration a song let us raise,
'Til all things now living unite in thanksgiving
To God in the highest, hosanna and praise.

Be the hands of Jesus, serving in His stead.

Challenged by the need apparent everywhere.
Where mankind is wanting, fill the vacant place.
Be the means through which the Lord reveals His grace.

Knowing Christ as Savior, make Him Master, too.
Follow in His footsteps, go where He has trod;
In the world's great trouble risk yourself for God.

See mankind as God sees, serve Him far and near.
Let your heart be broken by a brother's pain;
Share your rich resources, give and give again.

<string>467 Life Is Great! So Sing About It
Brian Wren          Peter Cutts
1
Life is great! So sing about it, As we can and as we should
Shops and buses, towns and people, Village, farmland, field and wood,
Life is great and life is given; Life is lovely, free and good.

2
Life is great! What ever happens, Snow or sunshine, joy or pain,
Hardship, grief or disillusion, Suffering that I can't explain
Life is great if someone loves me, Holds my hand and calls my name.

3
Love is great! The love of lovers, Whispered words and longing eyes;
Love that gazes at the cradle Where a child of loving lies;
Love that lasts when youth has faded, Bends with age, but never dies. 

4
Love is giving and receiving Boy and girl, or friend with friend;
Love is bearing and forgiving All the hurts that hate can send;
Love's the greatest way of living, Hoping, trusting to the end.

5
God is great! in Christ He loved us, As we should, but never can
Love that suffered, hoped and trusted When disciples turned and ran,
Love that broke through death forever. Praise that loving, living Man!

And though once so meek and lowly, Yet the Prince of heaven was He;
And the blind, who grope in darkness, Through the blood of Christ shall see.

Lift Him up, the risen Savior, High amid the waiting throng;
Lift Him up, 'tis He that speaketh, Now He bids you flee from wrong.

They with willing hearts shall seek Him, He will draw them to His fold;
They shall gather from the wayside, Hastening on with joyous feet,
They shall bear the cross of Jesus, And shall find salvation sweet.

3
Lift Him up in all His glory, 'Tis the Son of God on high;
Lift Him up, His love shall draw them, E'en the careless shall draw nigh;
Let them hear again the story Of the cross, the death of shame;
And from tongue to tongue repeat it; Mighty throngs shall bless His name.

4
O then lift Him up in singing, Lift the Savior up in prayer;

Yes, the young shall bow before Him, And the old their voices raise;
All the deaf shall hear hosannah; And the dumb shall shout His praise.

Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.

Given to His children as an act of Love;

They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.

Let Thy Shekinah glory Now shine forth from within,
And all the earth keep silence, The body henceforth be

Its members every moment Held subject to Thy call,
Ready to have Thee use them, Or not be used at all;
Held without restless longing, Or strain, or stress, or fret
Or chafings at Thy dealings, Or thoughts of vain regret.

4
But restful, calm, and pliant, From bend and bias free,
Awaiting Thy decision, When Thou hast need of me.
Live out Thy life within me, O Jesus, King of kings!
Be Thou the glorious answer To all my questionings.

How long, dear Savior! oh, how long Shall this bright hour delay?

Long upon the mountains weary, Have the scattered flock been torn;
Dark the dessert paths, and dreary; Grievous trials have they borne.
Now the gathering call is sounding, Solemn in its warning voice;
Union, faith, and love, abounding, Bid the little flock rejoice.

Now the light of truth they're seeking, In its onward track pursue;
All the ten commandments keeping, They are holy, just, and true.
On the words of life they're feeding, Precious to their taste so sweet;
All their Master's precepts heeding, Bowing humbly at His feet.

3
In that light of light and beauty, In that golden city fair,
Soon its pearly gates they'll enter, And of all its glories share.
There, divine the soul's expansions; Free from sin, and death, and pain;
Tear will never dim those mansions Where the saints immortal reign.

Soon He comes! with clouds descending; All His saints, entombed arise;
The redeemed, in anthems blending, Shout their vict'ry thro' the skies.
O, we long for Thine appearing; Come, O Savior, quickly come!
Blessed hope! our spirits cheering, Take Thy ransomed children home.

Weak and divided, soon to pass away;

Half free, half bound by inner chains, By social forces swept along,
By powers and systems close confined, Yet seeking hope for human kind.

Not thro' some merit, right, or claim, But by Your gracious love alone.
We strain to glimpse Your mercy seat, And find You kneeling at our feet.

Then take the towel, and break the bread, And humble us, and call us friends.
Suffer and serve till all are fed And show how grandly love intends
To work till all creation sings, To fill all worlds, to crown all things.

Give us Your Spirit's liberty To turn from guilt and dull despair
And offer all that faith can do, While love is making all things new.

<string>320 Lord of Creation
Jack Copley Winslow          Melvin West
1
Lord of creation, to You be all praise!
Most mighty Your working, most wondrous Your ways!
Your glory and might are beyond us to tell,
And yet in the heart of the humble You dwell.

2
Lord of all power, I give You my will,
In joyful obedience Your tasks to fulfill.
Your bondage is freedom; Your service is song;
And held in Your keeping, my weakness is strong.

3
Lord of all wisdom, I give You my mind,
Rich truth that surpasses man's knowledge to find;
What eye has not seen and what ear has not heard
Is taught by Your Spirit and shines from Your word.

4
Lord of all being, I give You my all,
If I ever disown You, I stumble and fall;
But led in Your service Your word to obey,
I'll walk in Your freedom to the end of the way.

Lord of our life, and God of our salvation,
Star of our night, and hope of every nation,
Hear and receive Thy church's supplication,
Lord God Almighty.

Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth;
Lord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth;
Lord, o'er Thy rock nor death nor hell prevaileth;
Grant us Thy peace, Lord.

Peace in Thy church, where brothers are engaging;
Peace, when the world its busy war is waging;
Send us, O Savior.

Grant us Thy help till foes are backward driven;
Grant them Thy truth that they may be forgiven;
Grant peace on earth, and, after we have striven,
Peace in Thy heaven.

Albert F. Bayly          Derek Williams
1
Lord of the boundless curves of space
And time's deep mystery,
To Your creative might we trace
All nature's energy.

2
Your mind conceived the galaxy,
Each atom's secret planned,
And every age of history
Your purpose, Lord, has spanned.

3
Yours is the image stamped on man,
Though marred by man's own sin;
And Yours the liberating plan
Again his soul to win.

4
Give us to know Your truth; but more,
The strength to do Your will;
Until the love our souls adore
Shall all our being fill.

Ne'er may a sinful thought destroy
The holy calm I find in thee,

Transporting is their rapturous song,
And heavenly visions seem revealed,

Thy presence with the day of rest;
Then will Thy servant never fail
To deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest,
To deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest.

Where springs of life arise,
Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,
And hidden glory lies.

It makes our sorrows blest;
Our fairest hope beyond the grave,
And our eternal rest.

To wrestlers with the troubled sea.

The songs of liberty.

Our country we commend;

Her everlasting friend.

Gifts, and the grace to sustain and renew,
Hear as we pray that today and each morrow
We to Thy purpose may show ourselves true.

Fearlessly speaking the word of the Lord,
Word of redemption thro' God's Son incarnate,
Blessing for cursing, and peace for the sword.

Tender and wise be the hearts of the pastors,
Guiding and guarding the souls in their care,
Firm with the wayward, a strength to the doubting,
Helping the needy their burdens to bear.

May those who teach grow in knowledge and patience,
Guiding to wisdom the young and the old,
Training for worship and witness and service,
Foes to all falsehood, in truthfulness bold.

Each needing other, and all having worth;
So to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit,
Glory be shown by the church here on earth.

Albert F. Bayly          The Sacred Harp
1
Lord, whose love in humble service
Bore the weight of human need,
Who upon the cross, forsaken,
Worked Your mercy's perfect deed:
We, Your servants, bring the worship
Not of voice alone, but heart;
Consecrating to Your purpose
Every gift which You impart.

2
Still Your children wander homeless;
Still the hungry cry for bread;
Still the captives long for freedom;
Still in grief we mourn our dead.
As You, Lord, in deep compassion
Healed the sick and freed the soul,
By Your Spirit send Your power
To our world to make it whole.

3
As we worship, grant us vision,
Till your love's revealing light
In its height and depth and greatness
Dawns upon our quickened sight,
Making known the needs and burdens
Your compassion bids us bear,
Stirring us to ardent service,
Your abundant life to share.

Love at home, love at home;
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,
When there's love at home.

Kindly heaven smiles above, When there's love at home;
All the earth is fill'd with love, When there's love at home.
Sweeter sings the brooklet by, Brighter beams the azure sky;
O, there's One who smiles on high When there's love at home.

3
Jesus, make me wholly Thine, Then there's love at home;
May Thy sacrifice be mine, Then there's love at home.
Safely from all harm I'll rest, With no sinful care distress'd,
Thro' Thy tender mercy blessed, When there's love at home.

<string>406 Love Consecrates the Humblest Act
S. B. McManus          Lucius Chapin
1
Love consecrates the humblest act
And haloes mercy's deeds;
It sheds a benediction sweet
And hallows human needs.

2
When in the shadow of the cross
Christ knelt and washed the feet
Of His disciples, He gave us
A sign of love complete.

3
Love serves and willing, stoops to serve;
What Christ in love so true
Has freely done for one and all,
Let us now gladly do!

Jesus Thou art all compassion, Pure, unbounded love Thou art;
Visit us with Thy salvation; Enter every trembling heart.

2
Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit Into every troubled breast!
Let us all in Thee inherit; Let us find the promised rest;
Take away our bent to sinning; Alpha and Omega be;
End of faith, as its beginning, Set our hearts at liberty.

3
Come, Almighty to deliver, Let us all Thy grace receive;
Suddenly return, and never, Never more Thy temples leave.
Thee we would be always blessing, Serve Thee as Thy hosts above,
Pray, and praise Thee without ceasing, Glory in Thy perfect love.

4
Finish, then, Thy new creation; Pure and spotless let us be.
Let us see Thy great salvation Perfectly restored in Thee;
Changed from glory into glory, Till in heaven we take our place,
Till we cast our crowns before Thee, Lost in wonder, love, and praise.

<string>Love Lifted Me

1
I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more;
But the Master of the sea heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me, now safe am I.

Refrain
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
Love lifted me!
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
Love lifted me!

All my heart to Him I give, ever to Him I'll cling,
In His blessed presence live, ever His praises sing;
Love so mighty and so true, merits my soul's best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too, to Him belongs.

Souls in danger, look above, Jesus completely saves,
He will lift you by His love, out of the angry waves;
He's the Master of the sea, billows His will obey;
He your Savior wants to be, be saved today.

Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep,
Keep Thy lamb, in safety keep;
Nothing can Thy power withstand;
None can pluck me from Thy hand.

Loving Shepherd, ever near,
Teach Thy lamb Thy voice to hear;
Suffer not my steps to stray
From the straight and narrow way.

Where Thou leadest I would go,
Walking in Thy steps below,
Till within the heavenly fold
I my Shepherd shall behold.

<string>568 Make Me a Captive, Lord
George Matheson          Arthur S. Sullivan
1
Make me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free;
Force me to render up my sword, and I shall conqueror be.
I sink in life's alarms when by myself I stand;
Imprison me within Thine arms, and strong shall be my hand.

2
My heart is weak and poor till it a master find;
It has no spring of action sure, it varies with the wind.
It cannot freely move till Thou has wrought its chain;
Enslave it with Thy matchless love, and deathless it shall reign.

3
My will is not my own till Thou hast made it Thine;
If it would reach a monarch's throne, it must its crown resign;
It only stands unbent, amid the clashing strife,
When on Thy bosom it has leant, and found in Thee its life.

And thus surround the throne, And thus surround the throne.

Refrain
We're marching to Zion, Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion, The beautiful city of God. 

2
Let those refuse to sing Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King, But children of the heavenly King,
May speak their joys abroad, May speak their joys abroad. 

3
The hill of Zion yields A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heavenly fields, Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Or walk the golden streets, Or walk the golden streets.

We're marching through Immanuel's ground, We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
To fairer worlds on high, To fairer worlds on high.

There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace, grace, God's grace,

Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold
Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.

Freely bestowed on all who believe!
You that are longing to see His face,

Carest Thou not that we perish? How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threat'ning A grave in the angry deep?

Refrain
The winds and the waves shall obey Thy will, Peace, be still!
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, Or demons or men, or whatever it be,
No waters can swallow the ship where lies The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will, Peace, be still! Peace, be still!
They all shall sweetly obey Thy will, Peace, peace, be still!

2
Master, with anguish of spirit I bow in my grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled Oh, waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish Sweep o'er my sinking soul;
And I perish! I perish! dear Master Oh, hasten, and take control.

3
Master, the terror is over, The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored, And heaven's within my breast;
Linger, O blessed Redeemer! Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor, And rest on the blissful shore.

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;

He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

Refrain
Glory! glory! Hallelujah! Glory! glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.

2
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free!
While God is marching on.

For there's a crown for me.

At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,
And His dear name repeat.

For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave.

<string>456 My God and I
Mary Ann Shorey          Hubert P. Main
1
My God and I go in the field together,
We walk and talk as good friends should and do;
We clasp our hands, our voices ring with laughter
My God and I walk thru the meadow's hue;
We clasp our hands, our voices ring with laughter
My God and I walk thru the meadow's hue.

2
He tells me of the years that went before me,
When heav'nly plans were made for me to be,
When all was but a dream of dim conception
To come to life, earth's verdant glory see;
When all was but a dream of dim conception
To come to life, earth's verdant glory see.

3
My God and I will go for aye together,
We'll walk and talk and just as good friends do;
This earth will pass, and with it common trifles
But God and I will go unendingly;
This earth will pass, and with it common trifles
But God and I will go unendingly.

<string>522 My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less
Edward Mote          William B. Bradbury
1
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

Refrain
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

2
When Darkness seems to veil His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

3
His oath, His covenant, and blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

4
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in Him be found;
Clad in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the follies of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

2
I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

3
I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee 'til death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

4
In mansions of glory and endless delight;
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

I have a Friend so precious, So very dear to me,
He loves me with such tender love, He loves so faithfully;
I could not live apart from Him, I love to feel Him nigh,
And so we dwell together, My Lord and I.

2
Sometimes I'm faint and weary, He knows that I am weak,
And as He bids me lean on Him, His help I gladly seek;
He leads me in the paths of light, Beneath a sunny sky,
And so we walk together, My Lord and I.

3
I tell Him all my sorrows, I tell Him all my joys,
I tell Him all that pleases me, I tell Him what annoys;
He tells me what I ought to do, He tells me how to try,
And so we talk together, My Lord and I.

4
He knows that I am longing Some weary soul to win,
And so He bids me go and speak The loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love, And why He came to die,
And so we work together, My Lord and I.

My Maker and my King,
To Thee my all I owe;
Thy sovereign bounty is the spring
Whence all my blessings flow;

Isaac Watts          Melvin West
1
My Shepherd will supply my need,
Jehovah is His name.
In pastures fresh He makes me feed
Beside the living stream.
He brings my wand'ring spirit back
When I forsake His ways,
And leads, me for His mercy's sake,
In paths of truth and grace.

2
When I walk through the shades of death,
Thy presence is my stay;
A word of Thy supporting breath
Drives all my fears away.
Thy hand in sight of all my foes
Doth still my table spread;
My cup with blessings overflows,
Thine oil anoints my head.

3
The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days;
O may Thy house be mine abode
And all my work be praise.
There would I find a settled rest
While others go and come;
No more a stranger or a guest,
But like a child at home.

<string>188 My Song Is Love Unknown
Samuel Crossman          John Ireland
1
My song is love unknown, My Savior's love to me,
Love to the loveless shown, That they might lovely be.
O who am I that for my sake My Lord should take frail flesh and die?

2
He came from His blest throne, Salvation to bestow,
But men made strange, and none The longed-for Christ would know.
But O my Friend, my Friend indeed Who at my need His life did spend.

3
Sometimes they strew His way, And His sweet praises sing,
Resounding all the day, Hosannas to their King.
Then "Crucify" is all their breath, And for His death they thirst and cry.

4
Why, what hath my Lord done? What makes this rage and spite?
He made the lame to run, He gave the blind their sight.
Sweet injuries! yet they at these Themselves displease, and 'gainst Him rise.

5
They rise, and needs will have My dear Lord made away;
A murderer they save, The Prince of life they slay.
Yet cheerful He to suff'ring goes, That He His foes from thence might free.

6
Here might I stay and sing, No story so divine:
Never was love, dear King, Never was grief like Thine!
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise I all my days could gladly spend.

My song shall be of Jesus,
His mercy crowns my days,

And tunes my heart to praise.
My song shall be of Jesus,
The precious Lamb of God,
Who gave Himself my ransom,
And bought me with His blood.

2
My song shall be of Jesus
When sitting at His feet,
I call to mind His goodness
And know my joy's complete;
My song shall be of Jesus,
Whatever ills befall,
I'll sing the grace that saves me,
And triumphs over all.

3
My song shall be of Jesus
While pressing on my way
To where my home shines glorious
In pure and perfect day.
And when my soul shall enter
The many mansions fair,
A song of praise to Jesus
I'll sing forever there.

George Heath          Lowell Mason

My soul, be on thy guard!
Ten thousand foes arise;
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw thee from the skies.

2
O watch, and fight, and pray!
The battle ne'er give o'er;
Renew it boldly every day,
And help divine implore.

Ne'er think the victory won,
Nor lay thine armor down;
Thy arduous task will not be done
Till thou obtain the crown.

Isaac Watts          Georg Joseph
1
Nature with open volume stands,
To spread its Maker's praise abroad;
And every labor of His hands
Shows something worthy of our God.

2
But in the grace that rescued us
His brightest form of glory shines;
'Tis fairest drawn upon the cross
In precious blood and crimson lines.

3
Here His whole name appears complete.
Nor wit can guess, nor reason prove,
Which of the letters best is writ,
The pow'r, the wisdom, or the love.

4
We would forever speak His name
In sounds to mortal ears unknown,
With angels join to praise the Lamb,
And worship at His Father's throne.

Flows from Calvary's mountain.

Refrain
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever,
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

3
Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadow o'er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.

Though like a wanderer, Daylight all gone,
Darkness be over me, My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I'd be Nearer, my God, to Thee,

There let the way appear, Steps unto heaven;
All that Thou sendest me, In mercy given;
Angels to beckon me Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Then, with my waking thoughts Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Sun, moon, and stars forgot, Upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be, Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nought as an offering to Jesus my King
Only my sinful now contrite heart,

Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
Through endless ages, ever to be,
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,

There is a land of pure delight,
Where bliss eternal reigns,
Infinite day excludes the night
And pleasures banish pain.

We're trav'ling to Immanuel's land,
We soon shall hear the trumpet sound,
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,
And never, never part again.
What! Never part again? No, never part again,
What! Never part again? No, never part again,
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,
And never, never part again.

There everlasting spring abides,
And never with'ring flowers,
And but a little space divides
This heav'nly land from ours.

Could we but stand where Moses stood,
And view the landscape o'er,
Not all this world's pretended good
Could ever charm us more.

New songs of celebration render
To Him who has great wonders done.
Love sits enthroned in ageless splendor:
Come, and adore the mighty One.
He has made known His great salvation
Which all His friends with joy confess:
He has revealed to every nation
His everlasting righteousness.

2
Joyfully, heartily resounding,
Let every instrument and voice
Peal out the praise of grace abounding
Calling the whole world to rejoice.
Trumpets and organs, set in motion
Such sounds as make the heavens ring;
All things that live in earth and ocean,
Make music for your mighty King.

3
Rivers and seas and torrents roaring,
Honor the Lord with wild acclaim;
Mountains and stones look up adoring,
And find a voice to praise His name.
Righteous, commanding, ever glorious,
Praises be His that never cease:
Just is our God, whose truth victorious,
Establishes the world in peace.

There's no death, no pain, nor fears;
And they count not time by years,
For there is "no night there."

In "the city four-square;"
All the streets with gold are laid,
And there is "no night there."

And the gates shall never close
To "the city four-square;"
There life's crystal river flows,
And there is "no night there."

There they need no sunshine bright,
In "that city four-square;"
For the Lamb is all the light,
And there is "no night there."

So that His blessed face may be seen;

Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him ever sever;

Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self denial,
Triumph at last, with nothing between!

To fill each human house with love,
It is the sacrament of care;

We humbly pledge ourselves to share.

To choose again the pilgrim way
And help us to accept with joy
The challenge of tomorrow's day.

Now praise the hidden God of love
In whom we all must live and move,
Who shepherds us, at every stage
Thro' youth, maturity, and age.

Who challenged us, when we were young
To storm the citadels of wrong;
In care for others taught us how
God's true community must grow.

3
Who bids us never lose our zest,
Tho' age is urging us to rest,
But proves to us that we have still
A work to do, a place to fill.

But Godward look, and upward climb,
Content to sleep, when day is done,
And rise refreshed, and travel on.

So we, when this new day is gone
And night in turn is drawing on,
With conscience by the world unstained
Shall praise His name for vict'ry gained.

Thinking that He would never wake again,
Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen;

Raised from the dead, my living Lord is seen;
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

O, for a closer walk with God!
A calm and heavenly frame,
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb!

Return, O holy Dove! return,
Sweet messenger of rest!
I hate the sins that made Thee mourn
And drove Thee from my breast.

What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
How sweet their memory still!
But they have left an aching void
The world can never fill.

Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
And worship only Thee.

William H. Bathurst          Jeremiah Ingallas
1
O for a faith that will not shrink,
Though pressed by many a foe;
That will not tremble on the brink of poverty,
Of poverty or woe; Of poverty or woe;

That will not murmur or complain
Beneath the chastening rod,
But in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain
Can lean upon its God; Can lean upon its God.

3
A faith that shines more bright and clear
When tempests rage without;
That when in danger knows no fear, knows of no fear,
In darkness feels no doubt; In darkness feels no doubt.

4
That bears unmoved the world's dread frown,
Nor heeds its scornful smile;
That sin's wild ocean cannot drown, no, cannot drown,
Nor its soft arts beguile; Nor its soft arts beguile.

5
Lord, give me such a faith as this,
And then, what-e'er may come
I'll taste e'en here the hallowed bliss, the hallowed bliss
Of an eternal home; Of an eternal home.

Proclaimed Thy love, and taught Thy ways?
Brightened Isaiah's vivid page,
And breathed in David's hallowed lays?

As when Elijah felt its power?
When glory beamed from Moses' brow,
Or Job endured the trying hour?

And while to Thee our hearts we raise,
On us Thy Holy Spirit pour.

O cleanse our prayers from human dross, Attune our lives to Thee,
Until we labor for those gifts We ask on bended knee.

Our best is but Thyself in us, Our highest thought Thy will;
To hear Thy voice we need but love, And listen, and be still.
We would not bend Thy will to ours, But blend our wills with Thine;
Not beat with cries on heaven's doors, But live Thy life divine.

Thou seekest us in love and truth More than our minds seek Thee;
Through open gates Thy power flows in Like flood tides from the sea.
No more we seek Thee from afar, Nor ask Thee for a sign,
Content to pray in life and love And toil, till all are Thine.

I hear Thee say, "Follow thou Me."
Thy message today illumines my way;
The Spirit of Prophecy.
I thrill at Thy marvelous love to Thy sheep,
The way Thou dost lead to the still waters deep,
One staff and one rod, One fold and one God;
My Shepherd, I follow Thee.

<string>19 O Sing a New Song to the Lord
Scottish Psalter          Jeremiah Clarke
1
O sing a new song to the Lord
For marvels He has done;
His right hand and His holy arm
The victory have won.

2
With harp, with harp and voice of psalms
Unto Jehovah sing;
Let trumpets and the echoing horn
Acclaim the Lord our King!

3
Let seas with all their creatures roar,
The world and dwellers there,
And let the rivers clap their hands,
The hills their joy declare.

4
Before the Lord: because He comes,
To judge the earth comes He;
He'll judge the world
with righteousness,
His folk with equity.

<string>144 O Sing a Song of Bethlehem
Louis F. Benson          Ralph Vaughan Williams
1
O sing a song of Bethlehem,
Of shepherds watching there,
And of the news that came to them
From angels in the air:
The light that shone on Bethlehem
Fills all the world today;
Of Jesus' birth and peace on earth
The angels sing alway.

2
O sing a song of Nazareth,
Of sunny days of joy,
O sing of fragrant flowers breath,
And of the sinless Boy:
For now the flowers of Nazareth
In every heart may grow;
Now spreads the fame of His dear name
On all the winds that blow.

3
O sing a song of Calvary,
Its glory and dismay;
Of Him who hung upon the tree,
And took our sins away:
For He who died on Calvary
Is risen from the grave;
And Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored,
Is mighty now to save.

E. E. Ryden          Traditional Finnish Melody
1
O sing my soul, your Maker's praise
In grateful hymns ascending;
Whose steadfast love has crowned your days
With heav'nly gifts un ending.
I sought the Lord, He heard my cry;
His holy angels hover nigh
The tents of those who love Him.

2
The Lord is good to those who seek
His face in time of sorrow,
Providing comfort to the weak
And grace for each tomorrow.
Though grief may tarry for a night,
The morn shall break in joy and light
With blessings from His presence.

3
The Lord will turn His face in peace
When troubled souls draw near Him;
His loving kindness shall not cease
To those who trust and fear Him.
Our God will not forsake His own;
Eternal is His heav'nly throne;
His kingdom stands forever.

<string>417 O Solemn Thought
Roswell F. Cottrell	Allen W. Foster
1
O solemn thought and can it be The hour of judgment now is come;
Which soon must fix our destiny, And seal the sinner's fearful doom?
Yes, it is so; the judgment hour Is swiftly hastening to its close;
Then will the Judge, in mighty power, Descend in vengeance on His foes.

2
He who came down to earth to die An offering for the sins of men,
And then ascended up on high, And will e'er long return again,
Is standing now before the ark, And mercy seat and cherubim,
To plead His blood for saints, and make The last remembrance of their sin.

3
The solemn moment is at hand When we who have His name confessed,
Each in his lot must singly stand And pass the final, searching test.
Jesus! we hope in Thee alone; In mercy now upon us look,
Confess our names before the throne, And blot our sins from out Thy book.

4
O blessed Savior! may we feel The full importance of this hour.
Inspire our hearts with holy zeal, And aid us by Thy Spirit's power,
That we may in Thy strength be strong, And brave the conflict valiantly;
Then, on Mount Zion, join the song, And swell the notes of victory.

The Father's help His children claim,
And sing the Father's glorious name. Amen.

O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,
On whom in affliction I call,
My comfort by day and my song in the night,
My hope, my salvation, my all!

2
His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,
Is heard through the shadows of death;
The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,
The air is perfumed with His breath.

3
His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,
To water the gardens of grace;
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
And bask in the smiles of His face.

4
He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
And myriads wait for His word;
He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.

Eben E. Rexford          George F. Root
1
O where are the reapers that garner in
The sheaves of the good from the fields of sin?
With sickles of truth must the work be done,
And no one may rest till the "harvest home."

Refrain
Where are the reapers? O who will come
And share in the glory of the "harvest home"?
O who will help us to garner in
The sheaves of good from the fields of sin?

2
The fields all are ripening, and far and wide
The world now is waiting the harvest tide:
But reapers are few, and the work is great,
And much will be lost should the harvest wait.

3
So come with your sickles, ye sons of men,
And gather together the golden grain;
Toil on till the Lord of the harvest come,
Then share ye His joy in the "harvest home."

1
O Word of God Incarnate, O Wisdom from on high,
O Truth unchanged, unchanging, O Light of our dark sky,
We praise Thee for the radiance that from the hallowed page,
A lantern to our footsteps, shines on from age to age.

2
The church from her dear Master received the gift divine,
And still that light she lifted o'er all the earth to shine.
It is the golden casket, where gems of truth are stored;
It is the heaven-drawn picture of Christ, the living Word.

3
It floateth like a banner before God's host unfurled;
It shineth like a beacon above the darkling world.
It is the chart and compass that o'er life's surging sea,
'Mid mists and rocks and quicksands, still guides, O Christ, to Thee.

4
O make Thy church, dear Savior, a lamp of purest gold,
To bear before the nations Thy true light, as of old.
O teach Thy wandering pilgrims by this their path to trace,
Till, clouds and darkness ended, they see Thee face to face.

<string>80 O World of God
R. B. Y. Scott          Gordon P. S. Jacob
1
O world of God, so vast and strange,
Profound and wonderful and fair,
Beyond the utmost reach of thought,
But not beyond a Father's care!
We are not strangers on this earth
Whirling amid the suns of space;
We are God's children, this our home,
With those of every clime and race.

2
O world of man where life is lived,
So strangely mingling joy and pain,
So full of evil and of good,
So needful that the good shall reign!
It is this world that God has loved,
And goodness was its Maker's plan,
The promise of God's triumph is
His coming in a Son of Man.

3
O world of time's far-stretching years!
There was a day when time stood still,
A central moment when there rose
A cross upon a cruel hill;
In pain and death love's power was seen,
The mystery of time revealed,
The wisdom of the ways of God,
The grace through which man's hurt is healed.

O worship the King, all glorious above,
O gratefully sing His wonderful love;
Our shield and defender, the Ancient of days,
Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.

2
O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space,
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

3
Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

4
Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,
In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail;
Thy mercies, how tender! how firm to the end!
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!

J. S. B. Monsell          Edwin Barnes
1
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;
With gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,
Kneel and adore Him: the Lord is His name.

2
Low at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness,
High on His heart He will bear it for thee,
Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,
Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.

3
Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness
Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine;
Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,
These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.

4
These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,
He will accept for the name that is dear;
Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,
Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.

To tell to all the world that God is light;

One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

Refrain
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
Tidings of Jesus, Redemption and release.

2
Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation
That God, in whom they live and move, is love;
Tell how he stooped to save His lost creation,
And died on earth that man might live above.

3
Give of thy sons to bear the message glorious;
Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;
Pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;
And all thou spendest Jesus will repay.

4
He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,
Make known to every heart His saving grace;
Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,
Through thy neglect, unfit to see His face.

That none can bear below.

And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning.
Our tongues shall chant the glories of our immortal King.

And in His kingdom rest?

Would here no longer stay;
Though Jordan's waves around me roll,
Fearless I'd launch away.

<string>149 Once in Royal David's City
Cecil Frances Alexander          Henry J. Gauntlett
1
Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed;
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little Child.

2
He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall;
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
Lived on earth our Savior holy.

3
And through all His wondrous childhood
He would honor and obey,
Love and watch the lowly mother
In whose gentle arms He lay.
Christian children all must be
Mild, obedient, good as He.

4
And our eyes at last shall see Him,
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above;
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone.

<string>606 Once to Every Man and Nation
James Russel Lowel          T. J. Williams
1
Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side;
Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom or blight,
And the choice goes by forever, 'twixt that darkness and that light.

2
Then to side with truth is noble, when we share her wretched crust,
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and 'tis prosperous to be just;
Then it is the brave man chooses while the coward stands aside,
Till the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied.

3
By the light of burning martyrs, Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,
Toiling up new Calvaries ever with the cross that turns not back;
New occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth,
They must upward still and onward, who would keep abreast of truth.

4
Though the cause of evil prosper, yet 'tis truth alone is strong;
Though her portion be the scaffold, and upon the throne be wrong;
Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own.

Only trust Him, only trust Him,
Only trust Him now;

2
For Jesus shed His precious blood
Rich blessings to bestow;
Plunge now into the crimson flood
That washes white as snow.

Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way,
That leads you into rest;
Believe in Him without delay,
And you are fully blest.

And on to glory go,
To dwell in that celestial land,
Where joys immortal flow.

We are not divided, all one body we,
One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.

Crowns and thrones have perished, kingdoms rise and wane,
But the church of Jesus constant will remain.
Gates of hell can never 'gainst that church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, that cannot fail.

Onward then, ye people! join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song;
Glory, praise, and honor unto Christ the King,
This through countless ages men and angels sing.

Fire ascending seeks the sun; both speed them to their source;
So a soul that's born of God, longs to view His glorious face,
Forward tends to His abode to rest in His embrace.

Soon our Savior will return, triumphant in the skies;
Yet a season, and you know happy entrance will be given,
All our sorrows left below, and earth exchanged for heaven.

All for sin could not atone;

When I soar to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

Wait till the night is o'er;
Wait till I see the morning
Break on the golden shore.

So, when breaks the vision of that kingdom fair,
Ours shall be its riches And its beauty rare.

As the silent leaven works its secret way,
Or as grows the seed grain through the night and day;

As the tender seedling grows up tall and strong,
And the birds of heaven to its branches throng;
So shall all God's children, from the east and west,
Gather to His kingdom, In its shadow rest.

Home shall come the childlike, born through Thee again;
Eager hearts arrive there on the pilgrim's road,

Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright;
Round yon virgin mother and Child!
Holy Infant, so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night,
Darkness flies, all is light;
Shepherds hear the angels sing,
"Alleluia! hail the King!
Christ the Savior is born,
Christ the Savior is born."

Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love's pure light,
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,

Silent night, holy night,
Wondrous star, lend thy light;
With the angels let us sing,
Alleluia to our King;
Christ the Savior is born,

Timothy Dudley-Smith          David G. Wilson

Sing a new song to the Lord,
He to whom wonders belong.
Rejoice in His triumph and tell of His power.
O sing a new song to the Lord.

2
Now to the ends of the earth
See His salvation is shown.
And still He remembers His mercy and truth,
Unchanging in love to His own.

3
Sing a new song and rejoice.
Publish His praises abroad.
Let voices in chorus with trumpet and horn,
Resound for the joy of the Lord.

4
Join with the hills and the sea,
Thunders of praise to prolong.
In judgement and justice
He comes to the earth
O sing a new song to the Lord.

1
Sing praise to God who reigns above,
The God of all creation,
The God of power, the God of love,
The God of our salvation.
With healing balm my soul He fills,
And every faithless murmur stills;
To God all praise and glory!

What God's almighty power hath made
His gracious mercy keepeth;
By morning glow or evening shade,
His watchful eye ne'er sleepeth,
Within the kingdom of his might,
Lo! all is just, and all is right:
To God all praise and glory!

3
The Lord is never far away,
Throughout all grief distressing,
An ever present help and stay,
Our peace and joy and blessing.
As with a mother's tender hand,
He leads His own, His chosen band:
To God all praise and glory!

4
Then all my gladsome way along,
I sing aloud Thy praises,
That men may hear the grateful song
My voice unwearied raises:
Be joyful in the Lord, my heart!
Both soul and body bear your part!
To God all praise and glory.

All praise to Him belongs;

His providence hath brought us through
Another various year;
We all, with vows and anthems new,
Before our God appear,
Before our God appear.

And Thy continued care;
To Thee presenting through Thy Son
What e'er we have and are,

Fred H. Kaan          George Henry Day
1
Sing we of the modern city,
Scene alike of joy and stress;
Sing we of its nameless people
In their urban wilderness.
Into endless rows of houses
Life is set a millionfold,
Life expressed in human beings
Daily born and growing old.

2
In the city full of people,
World of speed and hectic days,
In the ever-changing setting
Of the latest trend and craze,
Christ is present, and among us;
In the crowd we see Him stand.
In the bustle of the city
Jesus Christ is every man.

3
God is not remote in heaven,
But on earth to share our shame,
Changing graph and mass and number
Into persons with a name.
Christ has shown, beyond statistics,
Human life with glory crowned,
By His timeless presence proving
People matter, people count!

E. Margaret Clarkson          John W. Peterson

So sent I you by grace made strong to triumph
O'er hosts of hell, o'er darkness, death, and sin,
My name to bear, and in that name to conquer
So send I you, My victory to win.

2
So send I you to take to souls in bondage
The word of truth that sets the captive free,
To break the bonds of sin, to loose dearth's fetters
So send I you, to bring the lost to Me.

3
So send I you My strength to know in weakness,
My joy in grief, My perfect peace in pain,
To prove My power, My grace, My promised presence
So send I you, eternal fruit to gain.

4
So send I you to bear My cross with patience,
And then one day with joy to lay it down,
To hear My voice, "Well done, My faithful servant
Come, share My throne, My kingdom, and My crown!
"As the Father hath sent Me, So send I you."

Watching for you and for me.

Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary, come home;
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home!

Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

3
Think of the wonderful love He has promised,
Promised for you and for me;
Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me.

Pardon each infirmity,
Open fault, and secret sin.

Soon from us the light of day
Shall forever pass away;
Then, from sin and sorrow free,
Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.

Charles Wesley          Melvin West
1
Soldiers of Christ, arise, And put your armor on,
Strong in the strength which God supplies Through His eternal Son;
Strong in the Lord of hosts, And in His mighty power,
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts Is more than conqueror.

2
Stand then, in His great might, With all His strength endued,
But take, to arm you for the fight, The panoply of God;
That, having all things done, And all your conflicts passed,
You may o'er-come thro' Christ alone, And stand entire at last.

3
From strength to strength go on; Wrestle, and fight, and pray,
Tread all the powers of darkness down, And win the well-fought day;
Still let the Spirit cry, In all His soldiers, "Come!"
Till Christ the Lord who reigns on high Shall take the conquerors home.

Somerset C. Lowry          Dutch Folk Tune
1
Son of God, eternal Savior,
Source of life and truth and grace,
Word made flesh, whose birth among us
Hallows all our human race,
You our head, who throned in glory,
For Your own will ever plead:
Fill us with Your love and pity,
Heal our wrongs, and help our need.

2
Bind us all as one together
In Your church's sacred fold,
Weak and healthy, poor and wealthy,
Sad and joyful, young and old.
Is there want or pain or sorrow?
Make us all the burden share.
Are there spirits crushed and broken?
Teach us, Lord, to soothe their care.

3
As You, Lord, have lived for others,
So may we for others live.
Freely have Your gifts been granted;
Freely may Your servants give.
Yours the gold and Yours the silver,
Yours the wealth of land and sea;
We but stewards of Your bounty
Held in solemn trust will be.

4
Come, O Christ, and reign among us,
King of love and Prince of Peace;
Hush the storm of strife and passion,
Bid its cruel discords cease.
By Your patient years of toiling,
By Your silent hours of pain,
Quench our fevered thirst of pleasure,
Stem our selfish greed of gain.

5
Son of God, eternal Savior,
Source of life and truth and grace,
Word made flesh, whose birth among us
Hallows all our human race:
By Your praying, by Your willing
That Your people should be one,
Grant, oh, grant our hope's fruition:
Here on earth Your will be done.

But bright shall be your spring.

That which was sown an earthly seed
Shall rise a heav'nly flower.

Wean it from earth; through all its pulses move;

And make me love Thee as I ought to love.

No sudden rending of the veil of clay;
No angel visitant, no op'ning skies;
But take the dimness of my soul away.

Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King?
All, all Thine own, soul, heart, and strength, and mind;
I see Thy cross, there teach my heart to cling;
O let me seek Thee, and O let me find!

Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh;
Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear;
To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;
Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.

One holy passion filling all my frame;
The baptism of the heav'n-descended dove,
My heart an altar, and Thy love the flame.

Oxford Book of Carols          Ernest MacMillan

Spring has now unwrapped the flowers,
Day is fast reviving,
Life in all her growing powers
Towards the light is striving:
Gone the iron touch of cold,
Winter time and frost time,
Seedlings, working through the mould,
Now make up for lost time.

Herb and plant that winter long,
Slumbered at their leisure,
Now be stirring, green and strong,
Find in growth their pleasure:
All the world with beauty fills,
Gold the green enhancing;
Flowers make glee among the hills,
Set the meadows dancing.

3
Through each wonder of fair days
God Himself expresses;
Beauty follows all His ways,
As the world He blesses:
So, as He renews the earth,
Artist without rival,
In His grace of glad new birth
We must seek revival.

With grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer;

Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

Ye that are His now serve Him against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, and strength to strength oppose.

The arm of flesh will fail you, ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor, and watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger, be never wanting there.

A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,
So does this blessed consciousness, awaking,
Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.

When the soul waketh and life's shadows flee;
O in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,

Of heights and depths of mercy, 
Far deeper than the sea,

Life's pathway long ago;

And caused the blind to see;
And still His great heart yearn-eth
In love for even me.

'Twas wondrous love which led Him
For us to suffer loss
To bear without a murmur,
The anguish of the cross;
With saints re-deemed in glory,
Let us our voices raise,
Till heav'n and earth re-echo
With our Redeemer's praise.

Spend much time in secret with Jesus alone;
By looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be;

And run not before Him, whatever betide.
In joy or in sorrow, still follow thy Lord,
And, looking to Jesus, still trust in His word.

Each thought and each motive beneath His control;
Thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love,

Fanny J. Crosby          John R. Sweny
1
Tell me the story of Jesus,
Write on my heart every word,
Tell me the story most precious
Sweetest that ever was heard;
Tell how the angels, in chorus,
Sang as they welcomed His birth,
Glory to God in the highest,
Peace and good tidings to earth.

Refrain	
Tell me the story of Jesus,
Write on my heart every word,
Tell me the story most precious,
Sweetest that ever was heard.

2
Fasting, alone in the desert,
Tell of the days that He passed,
How for our sins He was tempted,
Yet was triumphant at last;
Tell of the years of His labor,
Tell of the sorrow He bore,
He was despised and afflicted,
Homeless, rejected, and poor.

3
Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,
Writhing in anguish and pain;
Tell of the grave where they laid Him,
Tell how He liveth again.
Love in that story so tender,
Clearer than ever I see;
Stay, let me weep while you whisper,
Love paid the ransom for me.

<string>31 Tell Out, My Soul
Timothy Dudley-Smith          Sydney Watson
1
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord:
Unnumbered blessings, give my spirit voice;
Tender to me the promise of His Word;
In God my Savior shall my heart rejoice.

2
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name:
Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done;
His mercy sure, from age to age the same;
His holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.

3
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might:
Pow'rs and dominions lay their glory by;
Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,
The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.

4
Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word:
Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord
To children's children and forevermore.

<string>433 Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand
H. Alford          John B. Dykes
1
Ten thousand times ten thousand, In sparkling raiment bright,
The armies of the ransomed saints Throng up the steeps of light.
'Tis finished, all is finished, Their fight with death and sin.
Fling open wide the golden gates, And let the victors in.

2
What rush of hallelujahs Fills all the earth and sky!
The ringing of a thousand harps Proclaims the triumph high.
O day for which creation And all its tribes were made!
O joy, for all its former woes A thousandfold repaid!

3
O then what raptured greetings On Canaan's happy shore!
What knitting severed friendship where Death partings are no more!
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle, That brimmed with tears of late;
Orphans no longer fatherless, Nor widows desolate.

4
Bring near Thy great salvation, Thou Lamb for sinners slain,
Fill up the roll of Thine elect, Then take Thy power and reign!
Appear, Desire of nations, Thine exiles long for home;
Show in the heavens Thy promised sign; Thou Prince and Savior come! 
</string>

<string>276 Thanks to God
R. T. Brooks          Peter Cutts
1
Thanks to God whose Word was spoken
In the deed that made the earth.
His the voice that called a nation;
His the fires that tried her worth.
God has spoken;
Praise Him for His open Word.

2
Thanks to God whose Word incarnate
Glorified the flesh of man.
Deeds and words and death and rising
Tell the grace in heaven's plan.
God has spoken;
Praise Him for His open Word.

3
Thanks to God whose Word is answered
By the Spirit's voice within.
Here we drink of joy unmeasured,
Life redeemed from death and sin.
God is speaking;
Praise Him for His open Word.

<string>209 That Glorious Day Is Coming
Anon.          Melvin West
1
That glorious day is coming,
The hour is hastening on;
Its radiant light is nearing,
Far brighter than the sun;
In yonder clouds of heaven,
The Savior will appear,
And gather all His chosen,
To meet Him in the air.

2
The saints, then all victorious
Will go to meet their Lord;
An earth both bright and glorious,
Will then be their reward;
And God Himself there reigning,
Will wipe all tears away;
Nor clouds nor night remaining,
But one eternal day.

2
O Christian, keep from sleeping,
And let your love abound;
Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,
The trumpet soon will sound!
O sinner, hear the warning!
To Jesus quickly fly!
Then you, in that blest morning,
May meet Him in the sky!

<string>117 The Advent of Our God
Charles Coffin and John Chandler          William H. Walter
1
The advent of our God
With eager prayers we greet,
And singing haste upon His road
His coming reign to meet.

2
The everlasting Son
Was born to make us free;
And He a servant's form put on
To gain our liberty.

3
As Judge, on clouds of light,
He soon will come again,
His scattered people to unite
With them in heaven to reign.

4
Praise to the incarnate Son
Who comes to set us free,
With Father, Spirit, ever one,
To all eternity.

<string>348 The Church Has One Foundation
Samuel J. Stone          Samuel S. Wesley
1
The church has one foundation 'tis Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is His new creation by water and the Word.
From heaven He came and sought her to be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her, and for her life He died.

2
Elect from every nation, yet one o'er all the earth;
Her charter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy name she blesses, partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses, with every grace endued.

3
Though with a scornful wonder men see her sore oppressed,
Though foes would rent asunder the Rock where she doth rest,
Yet saints their faith are keeping; their cry goes up, "How long?"
And soon the night of weeping shall be the morn of song.

4
'Mid toil and tribulation, and tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation of peace forevermore;
Till with the vision glorious her longing eyes are blest,
And the great church victorious shall be the church at rest.
</string>

<string>217 The Church Has Waited Long
Horatius Bonar          Horatio W. Parker
1
The church has waited long
Her absent Lord to see;
And still in loneliness she waits,
A friendless stranger she.

2
How long, O Lord our God,
Holy and true and good,
Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering church,
Her sighs and tears and blood?

3
We long to hear Thy voice,
To see Thee face to face,
To share Thy crown and glory then,
As now we share Thy grace.

4
Come, Lord, and wipe away
The curse, the sin, the stain,
And make this blighted world of ours
Thine own fair world again.

<string>332 The Cleansing Wave
Mrs. Phoebe Palmer          Mrs. Joseph F. Knapp
1
Oh now I see the crimson wave,
The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
Points to His wounded side.

Refrain
The cleansing stream I see, I see,
I plunge, and O, it cleanseth me!
O praise the Lord! it cleanseth me,
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.

2
I see the new creation rise,
I hear the speaking blood;
It speaks polluted nature dies,
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

3
I rise to walk in heaven's own light,
Above the world and sin;
With heart made pure and garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

4
Amazing grace! 'tis heaven below
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus, know,
My Jesus crucified.

<string>40 The Dawn of God's Dear Sabbath
Ada Cross          J. Walch
1
The dawn of God's dear Sabbath Breaks o'er the earth again,
As some sweet summer morning After a night of pain;
It comes as cooling showers To some exhausted land,
As shade of clustered palm trees 'Mid weary wastes of sand.

2
Lord, we would bring for offering, Though marred with earthly soil,
A week of earnest labor, Of steady, faithful toil,
Fair fruits of self denial, Of strong, deep love to Thee,
Fostered by Thine own Spirit, In true humility.

3
And we would bring our burden Of sinful thought and deed,
In Thy pure presence kneeling, From bondage to be freed,
Our heart's most bitter sorrow For all Thy work undone
So many talents wasted! So few bright laurels won!

4
And with that sorrow mingling, A steadfast faith, and sure,
And love so deep and fervent, For Thee to make it pure,
In Thy dear presence finding The pardon that we need,
And then the peace so lasting Celestial peace indeed.

<string>56 The Day Thou Gavest
John Ellerton          Clement C. Scholefield
1
The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended;
The darkness falls at Thy behest;
To Thee our morning hymns ascended;
Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.

2
We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping
While earth rolls onward into light,
Through all the world her watch is keeping,
And rests not now by day or night.

3
As o'er each continent and island
The dawn leads on another day,
The voice of prayer is never silent,
Nor die the strains of praise away.

4
So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,
Like earth's proud empires, pass away.
Thy kingdom stands, and grows forever,
Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.

<string>The Family of God

Refrain
I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God
I've been washed in the fountain cleansed by His blood!
Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod.
For I'm part of the family, the family of God.

1
You will notice we say "brother and sister" 'round here;
It's because we're a family and these folds are so near.
When one has a heartache we all share the tears,
And rejoice in each victory in this family so dear.

2
From the door of an orphanage to the house of the King
No longer an outcast, a new song I sing.
From rags unto riches, from the weak to the strong.
I'm not worthy to be here, but, praise God, I belong!

<string>118 The First Noel
Traditional English Coral          Sandy's Christmas Carols
1
The first noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Refrain
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

2
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

3
And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far,
To  seek for a king was their intent.
And to follow the star wherever it went.

4
This star drew nigh to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

5
Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon the knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.

When all my labors and trails are o'er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Refrain
O that will be glory for me, 
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.

2
When, by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

3
Friends will be there I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow,
Yet, just a smile form my Savior, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Thomas Olivers          Meyer Lyon
1
The God of Abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above;
Ancient of everlasting days,
And God of love;
Jehovah! Great I AM!
By earth and heaven confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred name,
Forever blest.

2
The God of Abraham praise,
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise, and seek the joys
At His right hand;
I all on earth forsake,
Its wisdom, fame and power;
And Him my only portion make,
My shield and tower.

3
The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high;
"Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!"
They ever cry;
Hail, Abraham's God and mine!
I join the heavenly lays;
All might and majesty are Thine,
And endless praise.

The Great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus;

O hear the voice of Jesus!

Refrain
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!

2
All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Savior's name,
I love the name of Jesus.

3
His name dispels my guilt and fear;
No other name but Jesus;
O how my soul delights to hear
The precious name of Jesus!

4
And when He comes to bring the crown
The crown of life and glory
Then by His side we will sit down,
And tell redemption's story.

<string>199 The Head That Once Was Crowned
Thomas Kelly          Melvin West
1
The head that once was crowned with thorns
Is crowned with glory now;
A royal diadem adorns
The mighty victor's brow.

2
The highest place that heaven affords
Is His, is His by right;
The King of kings, and Lord of lords,
And heaven's eternal light.

3
The joy of all who dwell above,
The joy of all below,
To whom He manifests His love,
And grants His name to know.

4
To them the cross, with all its shame,
With all its grace is given;
Their name an everlasting name,
Their joy the joy of heaven.

Hugh R. Haweis          George C. Stebbins
1
The homeland! O the homeland! The land of the free born!
There's no night in the homeland, But aye the fadeless morn;
I'm sighing for homeland, My heart is aching here;
There is no pain in the homeland To which I'm drawing near;
There is no pain in the homeland To which I'm drawing near.

2
My Lord is in the homeland, With angels bright and fair;
There's no sin in the homeland, And no temptation there;
The music of the homeland Is ringing in my ears;
And when I think of the homeland My eyes are filled with tears;
And when I think of the homeland My ears are filled with tears.

3
The dwellers in the homeland Are beckoning me to come,
Where neither death nor sorrow Invades their holy name;
O dear, dear native country! O rest and peace above!
Christ bring us all to the homeland Of Thy redeeming love;
Christ bring us all to the homeland Of Thy redeeming love.

F. E. Belden          F. E. Belden
1
The judgment has set, the books have been opened;
How shall we stand in that great day,
When every thought, and word, and action,
God, the righteous Judge, shall weigh?

Refrain
How shall we stand in that great day?
How shall we stand in that great day?
Shall we be found before Him wanting?
Or with our sins all washed away?

2
The work is begun with those who are sleeping,
Soon will the living here be tried,
Out of the books of God's remembrance,
His decision to abide.

3
O, how shall we stand that moment of searching,
When all our sins those books reveal?
When from that court, each case decided,
Shall be granted no appeal?

The King of love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never;
I nothing lack if I am His,
And He is mine forever.

2
Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth,
And, where the verdant pastures grow,
With food celestial feedeth.

3
Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,
But yet in love He sought me,
And on His shoulder gently laid,
And home, rejoicing, brought me.

And so through all the length of days
Thy goodness faileth never;
Good Shepherd! I would sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forever.

Not as of old a little child,
To bear and fight and die,
But crowned with glory like the sun
That lights the morning sky.

3
O, brighter than the rising morn
When Christ, victorious, rose
And left the lonesome place of death,
Despite the rage of foes.

O, brighter than that glorious morn
Shall dawn upon our race
The day when Christ in splendor comes,
And we shall see His face.

And light and beauty brings.
Hail, Christ the Lord! Your people pray:
Come quickly, King of kings.

Beneath His royal banner let every creature fall,
Exalt the King of heaven and earth, and crown Him Lord of all.

Will soon be tuned to nobler songs;
Our praise shall then, in realms of light,
With all His universe unite.

Faith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:
Then how can I ever in darkness remain?

With saints and with angels His praises I sing.

Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill,

<string>The Love of God

1
The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell;
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

Refrain
O love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure
The saints' and angels' song.

2
When years time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,
When men, who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call,
God's love so sure shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race
The saints' and angels' song.

3
Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made,
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Tho stretched from sky to sky.

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame,
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Refrain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it someday for a crown.

2
Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me,
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

3
To that old rugged cross I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

<string>386 The Sacred Anthem
Ottilie Stafford          Melvin West
1
The sacred anthem slowly rang
Across the fields of praise,
When earth's first Sabbath made complete
All creatures and all days.
Walking with God, there,
Woman and man together share
The blessed Sabbath mood;
And in that green and golden world
Know all God's works are good.

2
But now in our diminished lives
We sing a blemished song;
The earth is worn and disarrayed
And all our work goes wrong.
Still in our worship,
Joining in praise and fellowship,
By Sabbath radiance blessed,
We put our doubt and fear away
And rest within God's rest.

3
And arching over time and space
The Lord of Sabbaths wills
Renewal for the weary earth
And healing for our ills.
Hearts will rejoice then;
There will be no more weeping, when
We know and shall be known.
With hosts of the redeemed we'll sing
Around God's shining throne.

What is your answer to Him?

Time after time He has waited before,
And now He is waiting again
To see if you're willing to open the door:

If you'll take one step toward the Savior, my friend,
You'll find His arms open wide;
Receive Him, and all of your darkness will end,
Within your heart He'll abide.

3

Here bids us gather as His friends,
And share His wine and bread.

And name Him God and King.

For He, who gladly bore
The shameful cross, is ris'n again,
And reigns forevermore.

<string>96 The Spacious Firmament
Joseph Addison          F. J. Haydn
1
The spacious firmament on high,
With all the blue, ethereal sky,
And spangled heavens, a shining frame,
Their great Original proclaim.
Th'un-wearied sun from day to day
Does his Creator's power display,
And publishes to every land
The work of an almighty hand

2
Soon as the evening shades prevail,
The moon takes up the wondrous tale;
And nightly to the listening earth
Repeats the story of her birth;
While all the stars that round her burn,
And all the planets in their turn,
Confirm the tidings as they roll,
And spread the truth from pole to pole.

3
What though in solemn silence all
Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
What though no real voice nor sound
Amid their radiant orbs be found?
In reason's ear they all rejoice
And utter forth a glorious voice,
Forever singing as they shine,
"The hand that made us is divine."

<string>261 The Spirit of the Lord Revealed
George W. Briggs          David Gregor Corner
1
The Spirit of the Lord revealed
His will to saints of old;
Their heart and mind lips unsealed
His glory to unfold.
Amid the gloom of ancient night
They hailed the dawning Word,
And in the coming of the light
Proclaimed the coming Lord.

2
The prophets passed; at length there came
To sojourn and abide,
The Word incarnate, to whose name
The prophets testified;
And He, the twilight overpast,
Himself, the Light of light,
As man with man, revealed at last
The Father to our sight.

3
Eternal Spirit, who dost speak
To mind and conscience still,
That we in this our day, may seek
To do our Father's will,
To us the word of life impart,
Of Christ, the living way;
Give us the quiet, humble heart
To hear and to obey.

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

1
The strife is o'er, the battle done;
Now is the victor's triumph won!
Now be the song of praise begun. Alleluia!

The pow'rs of death have done their worst,
But Christ their legions has dispersed.
Let shouts of holy joy outburst. Alleluia!

All glory to our risen head! Alleluia!

4
Lord, by the stripes which wounded You,
From death's sting free Your servants too,
That we may live and sing to You. Alleluia!

N. B. Herrel          N. B. Herrel
1
Once our blessed Christ of beauty
Was veiled off from human views;
But through suffering, death, and sorrow
He has rent the veil in two.

Refrain
O behold the Man of Sorrows!
O behold Him in plain view!
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
Since He rent the veil in two;
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
Since He rent the veil in two.

2
Yes, He is with God, the Father,
Interceding there for you;
For He is the Well-beloved
Since He rent the veil in two.

3
Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the mighty Conqueror
Since He rent the veil in two.

<string>638 The Wise May Bring Their Learning
Book of Praise for Children          Melvin West
1
The wise may bring their learning,
The rich may bring their wealth,
And some may bring their greatness,
And some their strength and health:
We too would bring our treasures
To offer to the King,
We have no wealth or learning
What shall we children bring?

2
We'll bring Him hearts that love Him,
We'll bring Him thankful praise,
And young souls meekly striving
To follow in His ways:
And these shall be the treasures
We offer to the King,
And these are gifts that ever
The poorest child may bring.

3
We'll bring the little duties
We have to do each day;
We'll try our best to please Him
At home, at school, at play:
And better are these treasures
To offer to the King
Than richest gifts without them:
Yet these a child may bring.

<string>75 The Wonder of It All
George Beverly Shea          George Beverly Shea
1
There's the wonder of sunset at evening,
The wonder as sunrise I see;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is the wonder that God loves me.

Refrain
O, the wonder of it all!
The wonder of it all!
Just to think that God loves me.
O, the wonder of it all!
The wonder of it all!
Just to think that God loves me.

There's the wonder of springtime and harvest,
The sky, the stars, the sun;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is a wonder that's only begun.

<string>179 The Wonders of Redeeming Love
Roswell F. Cottrell          Perry Beach
1
The wonders of redeeming love
Our highest thoughts exceed;
The Son of God comes from above
For sinful man to bleed.

2
He gives Himself, His life, His all,
A sinless sacrifice.
For man He drains the cup of gall,
For man the victim dies.

3
And now before His Father's face
His precious blood He pleads;
For those who seek the throne of grace
His love still intercedes.

4
He knows the frailties of our frame,
For He has borne our grief;
Our great High Priest once felt the same,
And He can send relief.

5
His love will not be satisfied,
Till He in glory sees
The faithful ones for whom He died
From sin forever free. 
</string>

<string>336 There Is a Fountain
William Cowper          Early American Melody
1
There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.
Lose all their guilty stains, lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.

2
The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.
Wash all my sins away, wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.

3
Thou dying Lamb! Thy precious blood shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God are saved, to sin no more.
Are saved, to sin no more, are saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God are saved, to sin no more.

4
E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.
And shall be till I die, and shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.

5
Lord, I believe Thou hast prepared, unworthy though I be,
For me a blood-bought free reward, a golden harp for me!
A golden harp for me! A golden harp for me!
For me a blood-bought free reward, a golden harp for me!
There Is a Fountain

6
There in a nobler, sweeter song, I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the grave.
Is ransomed from the grave, is ransomed from the grave;
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the grave.

<string>164 There Is a Green Hill Far Away
Cecil Frances Alexander          William Horsley
1
There is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.

2
We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear,
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there.

3
He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heaven,
Saved by His precious blood.

4
There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of heaven, and let us in.

5
O dearly, dearly has He loved!
And we must love Him too,
And trust in His redeeming blood,
And try His works to do.

There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes;
But a glorious morrow when Jesus comes,

There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes;
And a joyful meeting when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.

Frederick D. Huntington          E. W. Dunbar
1
There'll be no night in heaven,
In that blest world above;

For labor there is love.

Refrain
There'll be no sorrow there,
There'll be no sorrow there;
In heaven above, where all is love,
There'll be no sorrow there.

2
There'll be no grief in heaven;
For life is one glad day,
And tears are those of former things
Which all have passed away.

There'll be no sin in heaven;
Behold that blessed throng,
All holy in their spotless robes,
All holy in their song.

S. F. Bennett          J. P. Webster
1
There's a song in the air! There's a star in the sky!
There's a mother's deep prayer And a baby's low cry!
And the star rains its fire while the beautiful sing,
For the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King!

2
There's a tumult of joy O'er the wonderful birth,
For the virgin's sweet boy Is the Lord of the earth.
Aye! the star rains its fire while the beautiful sing,
For the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King!

3
In the light of that star Lie the ages impearled;
And that song from afar Has swept over the world.
Every hearth is aflame, and the beautiful sing
In the homes of the nations that Jesus is King!

4
We rejoice in the light, And we echo the song
That comes down through the night From the heavenly throng.
Aye! we shout to the lovely evangel they bring,
And we greet in His cradle our Savior and King!

<string>584 There's a Spirit in the Air
Brian Wren          John Wilson
1
There's a Spirit in the air, telling Christians everywhere
"Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world."

2
Lose your shyness, find your tongue; tell the world what God has done:
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His pow'r today.

3
When believers break the bread, when a hungry child is fed:
Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.

4
Still His Spirit leads the fight, seeing wrong and setting right:
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His pow'r today.

5
When a stranger's not alone, where the homeless find a home,
Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.

<string>114 There's a Wideness
Frederick W. Faber          Lizzie S. Tourjee
1
There's a wideness in God's mercy,
Like the wideness of the sea;
There's a kindness in His justice,
Which is more than liberty.

2
There is welcome for the sinner,
And more graces for the good;
There is mercy with the Savior,
There is healing in His blood.

3
For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of man's mind.
And the heart of the Eternal,
Is most wonderfully kind.

4
If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His word;
And our lives would be all sunshine,
In the sweetness of our Lord.

There's no other name like Jesus,
'Tis the dearest name we know,
'Tis the angel's joy in heaven,
'Tis the Christian's joy below.

Refrain
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus.

2
There's no other name like Jesus
When the heart with grief is sad,
There's no other name like Jesus
When the heart is free and glad.

3
'Tis the hope that I shall see Him
When in glory He appears,
'Tis the hope to hear His welcome
That my fainting spirit cheers.

4
If He wills that I should labor
In His vineyard day by day,
Then 'tis well if only Jesus
Blesses all I do or say.

5
If He wills that death's cold finger
Touch my feeble, mortal clay,
Then 'tis well if only Jesus
Is my dying trust and stay.

There's sunshine in my soul today,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky,
For Jesus is my light.

Refrain
O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
When the peaceful, happy moments roll;
When Jesus shows His smiling face
There is sunshine in the soul.

2
There's music in my soul today,
A carol to my King,
And Jesus, listening, can hear
The songs I cannot sing.

3
There's springtime in my soul today,
For when the Lord is near,
The dove of peace sings in my heart,
The flowers of grace appear.

4
There's gladness in my soul today,
And hope, and praise, and love,
For blessings which He gives me now,
For joys "laid up" above.

Luther B. Bridgers          Luther B. Bridgers
1
There's within my heart a melody
Jesus whispers sweet and low:
Fear not, I am with thee, peace, be still,
In all of Life's ebb and flow.

Refrain
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
Sweetest name I know,
Fills my every longing,
Keeps me singing as I go.

2
All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
Discord filled my heart with pain;
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
Stirred the slumbering chords again.

3
Though sometimes He leads through waters deep,
Trials fall across the way,
Though sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
See His footprints all the way.

4
Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting neath His sheltering wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing.

5
Soon He's coming back to welcome me
Far beyond the starry sky;
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown;
I shall reign with Him on high.

Kept the folded grave-clothes Where Thy body lay.

Refrain
Thine is the glory, Risen, conquering Son;
Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won.

2
Lo! Jesus meets us. Risen from the tomb,
Lovingly He greets us, Scatters fear and gloom;
Let His Church with gladness Hymns of triumph sing,
For her Lord now liveth; Death hath lost its sting.

3
No more we doubt Thee, Glorious Prince of life!
Life is nought without Thee; Aid us in our strife;
Make us more than conquerors, Through Thy deathless love;
Bring us safe through Jordan To Thy home above.

This is my Father's world,
And to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings
The music of the spheres.
This is my Father's world:

Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
His hand the wonders wrought.

2
This is my Father's world,

The morning light, the lily white,
Declare their Maker's praise.
This is my Father's world:
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass;
He speaks to me everywhere.

3
This is my Father's world.
O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the Ruler yet.
This is my Father's world:
Why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!
God reigns; let the earth be glad!

You chose not Me, but I chose you
That you should go and bear much fruit.

For My name's sake you shall receive.
This is My will, My one command,
That love should dwell in each, in all.

Which, if we hold it fast,
Changes the world and us
And brings us home at last.

Emily E. S. Elliot          Timothy R. Matthews
1
Thou didst leave Thy throne And Thy kingly crown
When Thou camest to earth for me; But in Bethlehem's home
Was there found no room For Thy holy nativity.

Refrain 1-4
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee.

2
Heaven's arches rang When the angels sang
Proclaiming Thy royal degree; But of lowly birth
Didst Thou come to earth, And in greatest humility.

3
The foxes found rest, And the birds their nest
In the shade of the forest tree; But Thy couch was the sod,
O Thou Son of God, In the deserts of Galilee.

4
Thou camest, O Lord, With the living word
That should set Thy people free; But with mocking scorn,
And with crown of thorn, They bore Thee to Calvary.

5
When the heavens shall ring, And the angels sing,
At Thy coming to victory, Let Thy voice call me home,
Saying, "Yet there is room, There is room at My side for thee."

Refrain 5
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest for me.

Fred Pratt Green          James Bingham
1
Though I speak with tongues of men and angels,
Though I have the prophet's gift,
Though I hold the keys to hidden knowledge,
Though my faith can mountains shift;
Without love I am no better,
Without love it's all for naught;
Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:
What this means I would be taught.

2
Love is patient, knows no envy,
Never gloats when others sin;
Love is never glad to see injustice,
Always wants the truth to win.
There's no end to love's endurance,
There's no test it cannot face;
Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:
I shall fail without Your grace.

3
Though there'll be an end to hidden knowledge,
Visions, raptures, prophecy:
Faith and hope and love shall last forever,
Love the greatest of the three.
Without love I am no better,
Without love it's all for naught;
Lord, You gave Your life in saving others:
What this means I would be taught.

Silent through those three dread hours,
Wrestling with the evil powers,
Left alone with human sin,
Gloom around You and within,
Till th'appointed time is nigh,
Till the Lamb of God may die.

3
Hark, that cry that peals aloud
Upward through the whelming cloud!

You, His own anointed one,
You are asking can it be?
"Why have You forsaken Me?"

Lord, should fear and anguish roll
Darkly o'er our sinful soul,
You, who once were thus bereft
That Your own might ne'er be left,
Teach us by that bitter cry
In the gloom to know You nigh.

Edward Hayes Plumptre          Basil Harwood
1
Thy hand, O God, has guided Thy flock from age to age;
The wondrous tale is written Full clear on every page;
Our fathers owned Thy goodness, And we their deeds record;
And both of this bear witness, One church, one faith, one Lord.

2
Thy heralds brought glad tidings To greatest as to least;
They bade men rise and hasten To share the great King's feast:
And this was all their teaching, In every deed and word,
To all alike proclaiming One church, one faith, one Lord.

3
When shadows thick were falling, And all seemed sunk in night,
Thou, Lord, did send Thy servants, Thy chosen sons of light.
On them and on Thy people Thy plenteous grace was poured,
And this was still their message: One church, one faith, one Lord.

4
Thy mercy will not fail us, Nor leave Thy work undone;
With Thy right hand to help us, The vict'ry shall be won;
And then by men and angels Thy name shall be adored,
And this shall be their anthem: One church, one faith, one Lord.

For life and freedom, peace and brotherhood,
Till at the fullness of Thy truth arriving,

To preach the gospel of her Lord above,
Until the day this warring world rejoices
To hear the mighty harmonies of love.

And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt, and blind,

To the Savior who loves them their sorrows confide;
With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;

At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe,
That the blessings we're needing we'll surely receive;
In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;

<string>341 To God Be the Glory
Fanny J. Crosby          William H. Doane
1
To God be the glory, great things He hath done!
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
And opened the life gate that all may go in.

Refrain
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done!

2
O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

3
Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.

<string>646 To the Name That Brings Salvation
John Mason Neale and Robert F. Neill          Johann Christoph Bach
1
To the name that brings salvation
Let the nations bow the head;
Let them kneel in adoration
When this name of names is said;
Let them pray for restoration
Of all things in Christ the head.

2
He through every generation
Rules in endless majesty;
May the kings of every nation
Now foreswear their enmity,
And with humble veneration
In the love of God agree.

3
Lord, we pray for upright rulers:
Guard them surely in their need
From the vanity of power
And the emptiness of greed;
Let them see the truth of lowness,
And on justice let them feed.

<string>451 Together Let Us Sweetly Live
Millennial Harp          Melvin West
1
Together let us sweetly live,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
Together love to Jesus give;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

Refrain
O Canaan, bright Canaan,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
O Canaan, it is my happy home,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

2
Together let us watch and pray;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
And wait redemption's joyous day;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

3
Our songs of praise shall fill the skies;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
While higher still our joys shall rise;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

4
Then come with me, beloved friend;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
The joys to come shall never end;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

<string>479 Tread Softly
Fanny J. Crosby          William H. Doane
1
Be silent, be silent, A whisper is heard;
Be silent, and listen, Oh treasure each word.

Refrain
Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;
Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.

2
Be silent, be silent, For holy this place,
This altar that echoes The message of grace.

3
Be silent, be silent, Breathe humbly our prayer;
A foretaste of Eden This moment we share.

4
Be silent, be silent, His mercy record;
Be silent, be silent, And wait on the Lord.

<string>590 Trust and Obey
J. H. Sammis          Daniel B. Towner
1
When we walk with the Lord in the light of His word,
What a glory He sheds on our way! While we do His good will,
He abides with us still, and with all who will trust and obey.

Refrain
Trust and obey, for there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.

2
Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away; not a doubt nor a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear, can abide while we trust and obey.

3
Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay; not a grief or a loss,
Not a frown or a cross, but is blest if we trust and obey.

4
But we never can prove the delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay; for the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows, are for them who will trust and obey.

5
Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way; what He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go, never fear, only trust and obey.

<string>290 Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus
Helen H. Lemmel          Helen H. Lemmel
1
O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior,
And life more abundant and free!

Refrain
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

2
Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion,
For more than conqu'rors we are!

3
His Word shall not fail you He promised;
Believe Him and all will be well:
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!

<string>529 Under His Wings
W. O. Cushing          Ira D. Sankey
1
Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, and I am His child.

Refrain
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings, my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

2
Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, and there I am blest.

3
Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.

<string>632 Until Then
Stuart Hamblem          Stuart Hamblem
1
My heart can sing when I pause to remember,
A heartache here is but a stepping stone.
Along a trail, that's winding always upward,
This troubled world is not my final home.

Refrain
But until then my heart will go on singing,
Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold the city,
Until the day God calls me home.

2
The things of earth will dim and lose their value,
If we recall they're borrowed for awhile;
And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,
Remembered there will only bring a smile.

<string>102 Unto the Hills
John Campbell          James Bingham
1
Unto the hills around shall I lift up my longing eyes?
O whence for me shall my salvation come, from whence arise?
From God the Lord doth come my certain aid,
From God the Lord, who heav'n and earth hath made.

2
He will not suffer that thy foot be moved; safe shalt Thou be.
No careless slumber shall His eyelids close, who keepeth thee.
Behold our God, the Lord, He slumbereth ne'er,
Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.

3
Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true, thy changeless shade.
Jehovah they defense on thy right hand Himself hath made.
And thee no sun by day shall ever smite,
No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.

4
From every evil shall He keep thy soul, from every sin;
Jehovah shall preserve thy going out, thy coming in.
Above thee watching, He, whom we adore.,
Shall keep thee henceforth, yea, forevermore.

Wake the song of joy and gladness;
Hither bring your noblest lays;
Banish every thought of sadness,
Pouring forth your highest praise.
Sing to Him whose care has brought us
Once again with friends to meet,
And whose loving voice has taught us
Of the way to Jesus' feet.

Refrain
Wake the song, wake the song,
The song of joy and gladness,
Wake the song, wake the song,
The song of Jubilee.

2
Joyfully with songs and banners,
We will greet the festal day;
Shout aloud our glad hosannas,
And our grateful homage pay.
We will chant our Savior's glory
While our thoughts we raise above,
Telling still "the old, old, story,"
Precious theme redeeming love!

3
Thanks to Thee, O holy Father,
For the mercies of the year;
May each heart, as here we gather,
Swell with gratitude sincere,
Thanks to Thee, O loving Savior,
For redemption through Thy blood.
Breathe upon us, Holy Spirit,
Sweetly draw us near to God.

<string>210 Wake, Awake, for Night Is Flying
Catherine Winkworth          J. S. Bach 
1
Wake, awake, for night is flying,
The watchmen on the heights are crying,
Awake, Jerusalem, arise!
Midnight's solemn hour is tolling,
His chariot wheels are nearer rolling,
He comes; prepare, ye virgins wise.
Rise up with willing feet
Go forth, the Bridegroom meet; Alleluia!
Bear through the night your well-trimmed light,
Speed forth to join the marriage rite.

2
Zion hears the watchmen singing,
Her heart with deep delight is springing,
She wakes, she rises from her gloom;
Forth her Bridegroom comes, all-glorious,
In grace arrayed, by truth victorious;
Her Star is risen, her Light is come!
All hail, incarnate Lord,
Our crown, and our reward! Alleluia!
We haste along, in pomp and song,
And gladsome join the marriage throng.

3
Lamb of God, the heavens adore Thee,
And men and angels sing before Thee,
With harp and cymbal's clearest tone.
By the pearly gates in wonder
We stand, and swell the voice of thunder,
That echoes round Thy dazzling throne.
No vision ever brought,
No ear hath ever caught,
Such bliss and joy;
We raise the song, we swell the throng,
To praise Thee ages all along.

Ready for your Lord's returning.

Refrain
Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes;
Lo! He come, He comes all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious,
Lo! He comes, yes, Jesus comes.

2
Lo! the promise of your Savior,
Pardoned sin and purchased favor,
Blood-washed robes and crowns of glory;
Haste to tell redemption's story.

3
Kingdoms at their base are crumbling,
Hark! His chariot wheels are rumbling;
Tell, O tell of grace abounding,
While the seventh trump is sounding.

4
Nations wane, though proud and stately;
Christ His kingdom hasteneth greatly;
Earth her latest pangs is summing;
Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming.

5
Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;
Now for you He's interceding;
Haste, ere grace and time diminished
Shall proclaim the mystery finished.

H. L. Gilmour          William J. Kirkpatrick

Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,
Every soul a warning give;
Whosoever hears the message
May repent, and, turn and live.

Refrain
Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,
Blow it loud o'er land and sea;
God commissions, sound the message!
Every captive may be free.

2
Sound it loud o'er every hilltop,
Gloomy shade and sunny plain;
Ocean depths repeat the message,
Full salvation's glad refrain.

3
Sound it in the hedge and highway,
Earth's dark spots where exiles roam;
Let it tell all things are ready,
Father waits to welcome home.

4
Sound it for the heavy laden,
Weary, longing to be free;
Sound a Savior's invitation,
Sweetly saying, "Come to me."

Traveler, o'er yon mountain's height, see that glory beaming star.
Watchman, does its beauteous ray aught of joy or hope foretell?
Traveler, yes; it brings the day, promised day of Israel.

2
Watchman, tell us of the night, higher yet that star ascends.
Traveler, blessedness and light, peace and truth its course portends.
Watchman, will its beams alone gild the spot that gave them birth?
Traveler, ages are its own; See, it bursts o'er all the earth.

3
Watchman, tell us of the night, for the morning seems to dawn.
Traveler, darkness takes its flight, doubt and terror are withdrawn.
Watchman, let your wanderings cease; hasten to your quiet home.
Traveler, lo, the Prince of Peace, lo, the Son of God is come!

O'er your vision Shine there now some rays of light?
O'er your vision Shine there now some rays of light?

Are we nearing now the haven? Can we e'en the land descry?
Do we truly See the heavenly kingdom nigh?

Light is beaming, day is coming! Let us sound aloud the cry;
We behold the daystar rising Pure and bright in yonder sky!
Saints, be joyful; Your redemption draweth nigh;

We have found the chart and compass, And are sure the land is near;
Onward, onward we are hasting, Soon the haven will appear;
Let your voices Sound aloud your holy cheer;
Let your voices Sound aloud your holy cheer.

<string>617 We Are Living, We Are Dwelling
Arthur C. Coxe          Unknown
1
We are living, we are dwelling, In a grand and awful time,
In an age on ages telling; To be living is sublime.
Hark! the waking up of nations, Gog and Magog to the fray;
Hark! what soundeth? Is creation Groaning for her latter day?

2
Christian, rouse and arm for conflict, Nerve thee for the battlefield;
Bear the helmet of salvation, And the mighty gospel shield;
Let the breastplate, peace, be on thee, Take the Spirit's sword in hand;
Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then, In Jehovah's strength to stand.

3
And the prince of evil spirits, Great deceiver of the world!
He who at the blessed Jesus Once his deadly weapons hurled,
Cometh with unwonted power, Knowing that his reign will cease
When the kingdom shall be given To the mighty Prince of Peace.

4
Christians, rouse! fight in this warfare, Cease not till the victory's won;
Till your Captain loud proclaimeth, "Servant of the Lord, well done!"
He, alone, who thus is faithful, Who abideth to the end,
Hath the promise, in the kingdom An eternity to spend.

The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.
Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.

2
Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,
Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;
So from the beginning the fight we were winning;

And pray that Thou still our Defender wilt be.
Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;

<string>453 We Have Heard
W. H. Hydes          Unknown
1
We have heard from the bright, the holy, land; We have heard, and our hearts are glad;
For we were a lonely pilgrim band, And weary, and worn, and sad.
They tell us the saints have a dwelling there No longer are homeless ones;
And we know that the goodly land is fair, Where life's pure river runs.

2
They say green fields are waving there, That never a blight shall know;
And the deserts wild are blooming fair, And the roses of Sharon grow.
There are lovely birds in the bowers green, Their songs are blithe and sweet;
And their warblings, gushing ever new, The angels' harpings greet.

3
We have heard of the palms, the robes, the crowns, And the silvery band in white;
Of the city fair, with pearly gates, All radiant with light.
We have heard of the angels there, and saints, With their harps of gold, how they sing;
Of the mount with the fruitful tree of life, Of the leaves that healing bring.

4
The King of that country, He is fair, He's the joy and light of the place;
In His beauty we shall behold Him there, And bask in His smiling face,
We'll be there, we'll be there in a little while, We'll join the pure and the blest;
We'll have the palm, the robe, the crown, And forever be at rest.

<string>291 We Have Not Known Thee
Thomas B. Pollock          Joseph Barnby
1
We have not known Thee as we ought, Nor learned Thy wisdom, grace, and power;
The things of earth have filled our thoughts, And trifles of the passing hour.
Lord, give us light Thy truth to see, And make us wise in knowing Thee.

2
We have not feared Thee as we ought, Nor bowed beneath Thine awful eye,
Nor guarded deed, and word, and thought, Remembering that God was nigh.
Lord, give us faith to know Thee near, And grant the grace of holy fear.

3
We have not loved Thee as we ought, Nor cared that we are loved by Thee;
Thy presence we have coldly sought, And feebly longed Thy face to see.
Lord, give a pure and loving heart To feel and own the love Thou art.

4
We have not served Thee as we ought; Alas! the duties left undone,
The work with little fervor wrought, The battles lost, or scarcely won!
Lord, give the zeal, and give the might, For Thee to toil, for Thee to fight.

5
When shall we know Thee as we ought, And fear, and love, and serve aright!
When shall we, out of trial brought, Be perfect in the land of light!
Lord, may we day by day prepare To see Thy face, and serve Thee there.

We believe the time is here,
When the nations far and near

Hallelujah! Christ is King!
We have this hope that burns within our hearts,
Hope in the coming of the Lord.

We are united in Jesus Christ our Lord.
We are united in His love.
Love for the waiting people of the world,
People who need our Savior's love.

All the universe will sing
Hallelujah! Christ is King!
We have this hope, this faith, and God's great love,

When He shall return 'tis the promise most cheering
But we know not the hour.

Refrain
He will come, let us watch and be ready;
He will come, hallelujah! hallelujah!
He will come in the clouds of His Father's bright glory
But we know not the hour.

There's light for the wise who are seeking salvation;
There's truth in the book of the Lord's revelation;
Each prophecy points to the great consummation
But we know not the hour.

We'll watch and we'll pray, with our lamps trimmed and burning;
We'll work and we'll wait till the Master's returning;
We'll sing and rejoice, every omen discerning
But we know not the hour.

<string>561 We Plow the Fields
Jane M. Campbell          Johann A. P. Schulz
1
We plow the fields, and scatter the good seed on the land,
But it is fed and watered by God's almighty hand.
He sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain,
The breezes and the sunshine, and soft, refreshing rain. 

Refrain
All good gifts around us Are sent from heaven above;
Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord For all His love.

2
He only is the Maker of all things near and far;
He paints the wayside flower, He lights the evening star.
The winds and waves obey Him, by Him the birds are fed;
Much more, to us His children, He gives our daily bread.

3
We thank Thee then, O Father, for all things bright and good:
The seed-time and the harvest, our life, our health, our food.
Accept the gifts we offer for all Thy love imparts,
And, what Thou most desirest, our humble, thankful hearts.

To teach what Christ hath taught.
In all our learning may we seek
That wisdom from above
Which comes to all: the brave, the meek
Who ask in faith and love.

2
We praise Thee thro' our bodies, Lord,
Kept strong to do Thy will;
Thy Spirit's temples, which afford
A means to praise Thee still.
We give ourselves, a sacrifice,
To live as unto Thee;
For Thou alone hast paid the price
To bring salvation free.

3
We praise Thee in our hearts, O King,
Kept pure to know Thy ways;
And raise to Thee a hymn to sing
Eternally Thy praise.
Altho adoring hearts will bow
As age on ages roll;
We praise Thee in our beings now,
Mind, body, heart, and soul.

Elizabeth Mills          Lewis Edson

We speak of the realms of the blest, That country so bright and so fair,
And oft are its glories confessed But what must it be to be there!
We speak of its pathway of gold Its walls decked with jewels so rare,
Its wonders and pleasures untold But what must it be to be there!

2
We speak of its freedom of sin, From sorrow, temptation and care,
From trials without and within But what must it be to be there!
We speak of its service of love, Of the robes which the glorified wear,
Of the church of the First Born above But what must it be to be there!

3
Our mourning is all at an end, When, raised by the life-giving word,
We see the new city descend, Adorned as a bride for her Lord;
The city so holy and clean, No sorrow can breathe in the air;
No gloom of affliction or sin, No shadow of evil, is there.

4
Do Thou, midst temptation and woe, For heaven my spirit prepare;
And shortly I also shall know And feel what it is to be there.
Then o'er the bright fields we shall roam, In glory celestial and fair,
With saints and with angels at home, And Jesus Himself will be there.

2
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,

3
Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh;
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.

Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom:
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stonecold tomb.

Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and sacrifice;
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Sounds through the earth and skies.

"We would see Jesus;" for the shadows lengthen
Across the little landscape of our life;
We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen
For the last conflict, in this mortal strife.

2
"We would see Jesus," Rock of our salvation,
Where on our feet were set with sovereign grace;
Not life, nor death, with all their agitation,
Can thence remove us, gazing on His face.	

3
"We would see Jesus;" other lights are paling,
Which for long years we did rejoice to see;
The blessings of this sinful world are failing;
We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.

"We would see Jesus;" this is all we're needing;
Strength, joy, and willingness come with the sight;
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,
Soon to return and end this mortal night!

On visions of earthly treasure;
Some build on the waves of sin and strife,
Of fame, and worldly pleasure.

3
O build on the Rock, forever sure,
The firm and the true foundation;
Its hope is the hope which shall endure,
The hope of our salvation.

That shall turn their hearts to the right,
A story of truth and mercy,
A story of peace and light,

And shatter the spear and sword,

That the Lord who reigneth above
Hath sent us His Son to save us,
And show us that God is love,

Who the path of sorrow hath trod,

Might come to the truth of God,

<string>499 What a Friend We Have in Jesus
John M. Scriven           Charles C. Converse
1
What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear;
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer.

2
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
Can we find a friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
Take it to the Lord in prayer!

3
Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.

What child is this, who, laid to rest,
On Mary`s lap is sleeping?

While shepherds watch are keeping?

Refrain
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The babe, the son of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own Him,
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

Rulers of men, give ear! Should you not justice show?
Will God your pleading hear, while crime and cruelty grow?

Let Christ endue our will with grace to fortify.
Then justly, in mercy we'll humbly walk with God.

On the banks of old Jordan, here gazing I stand,
And earnestly longing, I stretch forth my hand;
Send a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray!
Let me join that sweet music; come, take me away.

If Jesus permit, the wild surges I'll brave;
For that heavenly music hath ravished me so,
I must join in that chorus! I'll go! let me go!

What joy it is to worship here,
And find ourselves at home,

If we would share His grace.

<string>162 When Christ Was Lifted From the Earth
Alexander Means          Richard Proulx
1
When Christ was lifted from the earth His arms stretched out above
Through every culture, every birth, to draw an answering love.

2
Still east and west His love extends and always, near or far,
He calls and claims us as His friends and loves us as we are.

3
Where generation, class, or race divides us to our shame,
He sees not labels but a face, a person and a name.

Thus freely loved, tho' fully known, may I in Christ be free
To welcome and accept His own as Christ accepted me.

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?	

3
Since I, who was undone and lost,
Have pardon through His name and word;
Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
Save in the cross of Christ my Lord.

That were a tribute far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my life, my soul, my all.

When in our music God is glorified,
And adoration leaves no room for pride,
It is as though the whole creation cried:

2
How oft, in making music, we have found
A new dimension in the world of sound,
As worship moved us to a more profound
Alleluia!

And did not Jesus sing a psalm that night
When utmost evil strove against the light?
Then let us sing for whom He won the fight:

Let every instrument be used for praise;
Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise;
And may God give us faith to sing always:
Alleluia!

Into the deepest quarters Of all creation round;
And at this wondrous greeting The dead in Christ shall rise,

May Jesus Christ praised!

Let earth, and sea and sky from depth to height reply,
May Jesus Christ praised!

Be this th'eternal song through all the ages long,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

When on life a darkness falls,
When the mist flows chilling,
Paths and signposts lost in doubt,
Loveless, unfulfilling,
Reach us, Jesus, from Your cross,
Though we feel forsaken;
Keep us through the aching night
Till new dawns awaken.

2
When the dreams and vows of youth
Painfully accuse us,
Stab our conscience, steal our worth,
Christ will not refuse us:
Peace the world cannot provide,
Daily resurrection,
Strong companion at our side
For each new direction.

3
Come and meet Him, Friend and Lord,
Thro' the gospel story:
Open door to life and peace,
Window into glory.
All who seek Him, soon are found,
Made His close relation:
Christ our pathway, Christ our home,
Christ our sure foundation.

When the church of Jesus shuts its outer door,
Lest the roar of traffic drown the voice of prayer:
May our prayers, Lord make up ten times more aware
That the world we banish is our Christian care.

If our hearts are lifted where devotion soars
High above this hungry suffering world of ours:
Lest our hymns should drug us to forget its needs,
Forge our Christian worship into Christian deeds.

3
Lest the gifts we offer, money, talents, time,
Serve to salve our conscience to our secret shame:
Lord, reprove, inspire us by the way You give;
Teach us, dying Savior, how true Christians live.

Trusting, serving every day;

Will the toils of life repay.

Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open;
We shall tread the streets of gold.

From human grief and burdened toil,
From famished souls, from sorrow's stress,

Still holds the freshness of Your grace;
Yet long these multitudes to view
The strong compassion in Your face.

Make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
Among these restless throngs abide;
O tread the city's streets again.

Till all the world shall learn Your love
And follow where Your feet have trod,
Till, glorious from Your heaven above,
Shall come the city of our God.

Steadfast and sure while the billows roll;

Can defy the blast, through strength divine.

When the breakers tell that the reef is near;
Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,
Not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.

When the waters cold chill our latest breath;
On the rising tide it can never fail,
While our hopes abide within the veil.

When our eyes behold, in the dawning light,
Shining gates of pearl, our harbor bright,
We shall anchor fast to the heavenly shore,
With the storms all past forevermore.

And wintry days appear.

And bids the spring return.

Obey His mighty word:
With songs and honors sounding loud
Praise ye the sovereign Lord!

And through eternity I'll sing on, I'll sing on!
And through eternity, I'll sing on.

<string>375 Work, for the Night Is Coming
Mrs. Anna L. Coghill          Melvin West
1
Work, for the night is coming;
Work through the morning hours;
Work while the dew is sparkling;
Work 'mid springing flowers.
Work while the day grows brighter,
Under the glowing sun;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man's work is done.

2
Work, for the night is coming;
Work through the sunny noon;
Fill brightest hours with labor,
Rest comes sure and soon.
Give every flying minute
Something to keep in store;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man works no more.

3
Work, for the night is coming:
Under the sunset skies;
While their bright tints are glowing,
Work for daylight flies.
Work till the last beam fadeth,
Fadeth to shine no more;
Work, for the Lord is coming,
When man's work is o'er.

<string>582 Working, O Christ, With Thee
W. A. Ogden          Arthur S. Sullivan
1
Working, O Christ, with Thee, working with Thee,
Unworthy, sinful, weak, though we may be;
Our all to Thee we give, for Thee alone we live,
And by Thy grace achieve, working with Thee.

2
Along the city's waste, working with Thee,
Our eager footsteps haste, like Thee to be;
The poor we gather in, the outcasts raise from sin,
And labor souls to win, working with Thee.

3
Savior, we weary not, working with Thee,
As hard as Thine our lot can never be;
Our joy and comfort this, "Thy grace sufficient is;"
This changes toil to bliss, working with Thee.

4
So let us labor on, working with Thee,
Till earth to Thee is won, from sin set free;
Till men, from shore to shore, receive Thee, and adore,
And join us evermore, working with Thee.

And publish abroad His wonderful name;
The name all victorious of Jesus extol;

And still He is nigh, His presence we have;
The great congregation His triumph shall sing,
Ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.

All glory and power, all wisdom and might,
All honor and blessing, with angels above,
And thanks never ceasing, for infinite love.

Living stones by God appointed
Each to his allotted place,
Kings and priests, by God anointed,
Shall you not declare His grace?
You, a royal generation,
Tell the tidings of your birth,
Tidings of a new creation
To an old and weary earth.

Tell the praise of Him who called you
Out of darkness into light,
Broke the fetters that enthralled you,
Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:
Tell the tale of sins forgiven,
Strength renewed and hope restored,
Till the earth, in tune with heaven,
Praise and magnify the Lord.

<string>696 I Will Extol The Lord
Psalm 34, N.I.V.

I will extol the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips. My soul will boast in the Lord; let the afflicted hear and rejoice. Glorify the LORD with me; let us exalt his name together.

I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.

This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them.

Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. Fear the Lord, you his saints, for those who fear him lack nothing.

The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.

Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned. The Lord redeems his servants; no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.

<string>697 Shout With Joy To God All The Earth
Psalm 66, N.I.V.

Shout with joy to God, all the earth! Sing to the glory of his name; offer him glory and praise!

Praise our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard; he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.

For you, O God, tested us; you refined us like silver. You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs. 

You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.

I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you-- vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.

Come and listen, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me. I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.

If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened; but God has surely listened and heard my voice in prayer.

Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!

<string>698 How Lovely Is Thy Dwelling Place (RR)
Psalm 84, R.S.V.

How lovely is thy dwelling place, O Lord of hosts!

My soul longs, yea, faints for the courts of the Lord; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God.

Even the sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in thy house, ever singing thy praise!

For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.

For the Lord God is a sun and shield; he bestows favor and honor. No good thing does the Lord withhold from those who walk uprightly.

O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in thee!

<string>699 O Come Let Us Sing Unto The Lord
Psalm 95, K.J.V.

O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him, with psalms.

For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also. The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.

O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our maker.

For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.

<string>700 Oh Sing To The Lord A New Song
Psalm 96, K.J.V.

Oh, sing to the Lord a new song! Sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to the Lord, bless His name;

Proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day. Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.

For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the Lord made the heavens.

Honor and majesty are before Him; Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.

Give to the Lord, O kindreds of the peoples, Give to the Lord glory and strength.

Give to the Lord the glory due His name; Bring an offering, and come into His courts. Oh, worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness! Tremble before Him, all the earth.

Say among the nations, "The Lord reigns; The world also is firmly established, It shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples righteously."

Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad; Let the sea roar, and all its fullness; Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the woods will rejoice before the Lord.

For He is coming, for He is coming to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with His truth.

Psalm 1OO, N.A.S.B. 701

Psalm 105, N.A.S.B.

Remember His wonders which He as done, His marvels, and the judgments uttered by His mouth, O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!

Psalms 113 and 114, N.E.B.

O praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, you that are his servants, praise the name of the Lord.

Blessed be the name of the Lord now and evermore. From the rising of the sun to its setting may the Lord's name be praised.

High is the Lord above all nations, his glory above the heavens. There is none like the Lord our God in heaven or on earth, who sets his throne so high but deigns to look down so low;

who lifts the weak out of the dust and raises the poor from the dunghill, giving them a place among princes, among the princes of his people; who makes the woman in a childless house a happy mother of children.

O praise the Lord.

<string>704 If I Lift Up My Eyes To The Hills
Psalm 121, N.E.B.

If I lift up my eyes to the hills, where shall I find help?

Help comes only from the Lord, maker of heaven and earth.

How could he let your foot stumble? How could he, your guardian, sleep?

The guardian of Israel never slumbers, never sleeps.

The Lord is your guardian, your defence at your right hand; the sun will not strike you by day nor the moon by night.

The Lord will guard you against all evil; he will guard you, body and soul.

The Lord will guard your going and your coming, now and for evermore.

Psalm 145, N.I.V.

I will exalt you, my God the King; I will praise your name for ever and ever. Every day I will praise you and extol your name for ever and ever.

Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom. One generation will commend your works to another; they will tell of your mighty acts.

They will celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness. The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.

The Lord is faithful to all his promises and loving toward all he has made. The Lord upholds all those who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.

The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food at the proper time. You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.

The Lord is righteous in all His ways and loving toward all he has made. The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.

He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them. The Lord watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.

My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord. Let every creature praise his holy name for ever and ever.

Let earth praise Yahweh: sea-monsters and all the deeps, fire and hail, snow and mist, gales that obey his decree,

mountains and hills, orchards and forests, wild animals and farm animals, snakes and birds,

all kings on earth and nations, princes, all rulers in the world, young men and girls, old people, and children too!

Ephesians 1, 2, and 4, R.S.V.

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.

In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace which he lavished upon us.

In him you also, who have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and have believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, which is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. 

But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ.

He came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.

There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all, who is above all and through all and in all.

O God, the proud have risen against me, And a mob of violent men have sought my life, And have not set You before them.

But You, O Lord, are a God full of compassion, and gracious, Longsuffering and abundant in mercy and truth.

Oh, turn to me, and have mercy on me! Give Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your maidservant.

Show me a sign for good, That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, Because You, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.

He forgives all my sins and heals all my diseases; he redeems my life from the pit and crowns me with love and compassion. He satisfies my desires with good things, so that my youth is renewed like the eagle's.

The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love. . . . He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.

For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.

<string>713 Love Of God
1 John 4 and John 3, N.K.J.V.

In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.

"For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved."

In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

God is love, and be who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.

Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

If someone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?

And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also.

Psalm 8, N.I.V.

O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.

From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise because of your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.

When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,

what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?

You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.

You made him ruler over the works of your hands: you put everything under his feet: all locks and herds, and the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.

O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!

<string>715 I Will Extol The Lord With All My Heart
Psalm 111, N.I.V.

Praise the Lord. I will extol the Lord with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.

Great are the works of the Lord; they are pondered by all who delight in them. Glorious and majestic are his deeds, and his righteousness endures forever.

He has caused his wonders to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and compassionate. He provides food for those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever.

He has shown his people the power of his works, giving them the lands of other nations. The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy.

They are steadfast for ever and ever, done in faithfulness and uprightness. He provided redemption for his people; he ordained his covenant forever holy and awesome is his name.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.

<string>716 The Liberating Creator
Isaiah 42. N.E.B.

Thus speaks the Lord who is God, he who created the skies and stretched them out, who fashioned the earth and all that grows in it, who gave breath to its people, the breath of life to all who walk upon it:

I, the Lord, have called you with righteous purpose and taken you by the hand; I have formed you, and appointed you to be a light to all peoples, a beacon for the nations, to open eyes that are blind, to bring captives out of prison, out of the dungeons where they lie in darkness.

I am the Lord; the Lord is my name; I will not give my glory to another god, nor my praise to any idol.

See how the first prophecies have come to pass, and now I declare new things; before they break from the bud I announce them to you.

Sing a new song to the Lord, sing his praise throughout the earth, you that sail the sea, and all sea creatures, and you that inhabit the coasts and islands.

Let the wilderness and its towns rejoice, and the villages of the tribe of Kedar. Let those who live in Sela shout for joy and cry out from the hill-tops.

You coasts and islands, all uplift his praises; let all ascribe glory to the Lord.

<string>717 The Heavens Declare The Glory Of God
Psalm 19, N.I.V.

The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.

There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.

In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun, which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.

It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat.

The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.

<string>718 Rejoice In The Lord
Psalm 33, N.K.J.V.

Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous! For praise from the upright is beautiful.

Praise the Lord with the harp; Make melody to Him with an instrument of ten strings.

Sing to Him a new song; Play skillfully with a shout of joy.

For the word of the Lord is right, And all His work is done in truth. He loves righteousness and justice; The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.

By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth. He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He lays up the deep in storehouses.

Let all the earth fear the Lord; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.
</string>

<string>719 Our Lord The Creator
Isaiah 42 and 45, N.I.V.

This is what God the Lord say-he who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth, and all that comes out of it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it.

"I am the Lord, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged me, so that from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting men may know there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is no other."

"You heavens above, rain down righteousness; let the clouds shower it down. Let the earth open wide, let salvation spring up, let righteousness grow with it; I, the Lord, have created it."

For this is what the Lord says-he who created the heavens, he is God; he who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited-he says:

"I am the Lord, and there is no other. . . . Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other."

<string>720 God Is Our Refuge And Strength
Psalm 46, N.K.J.V.

God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.

Therefore we will not fear, Though the earth be removed, And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; Though its waters roar and be troubled, Though the mountains shake with its swelling.

There is a river whose streams shall make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her, just at the break of dawn.

The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.

The Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge.

Come, behold the works of the Lord, Who has made desolations in the earth. He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariot in the fire.

Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!

The Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge.

Lord, you have been our refuge age after age.

Before the mountains were born before the earth or the world came to birth, you were God from all eternity and for ever.

You can turn man back into dust by saying, "Back to what you were, you sons of men!" To you, a thousand years are a single day, a yesterday now over, an hour of the night.

You brush men away like waking dreams, they are like grass sprouting and flowering in the morning, withered and dry before dusk.

We too are burnt up by your anger and terrified by your fury; having summoned up our sins you inspect our secrets by your own light.

Our days dwindle under your wrath, our lives are over in a breath-our life lasts for seventy years, eighty with good health,

but they all add up to anxiety and trouble-over in a trice, and then we are gone. Who yet has felt the full force of your fury, or learnt to fear the violence of your rage?

Teach us to count how few days we have and so gain wisdom of heart.

<string>722 He That Dwelleth In The Secret Place
Psalm 91, K.J.V.

He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.

Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.

He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.

Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

<string>723 O Give Thanks To The Lord For He Is Good
Psalm 107, R.S.V.

O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever!

Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom be bas redeemed from trouble and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.

Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in; hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.

Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and be delivered them from their distress; be led them by a straight way, till they reached a city to dwell in.

Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men! For he satisfies him who is thirsty, and the hungry he fills with good things.

Some sat in darkness and in gloom, prisoners in affliction and in irons, for they bad rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High.

Their hearts were bowed down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help.

Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress; he brought them out of darkness and gloom, and broke their bonds asunder.

Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

<string>724 O Lord You Have Searched Me
Psalm 139, N.K.J.V.

O Lord, You have searched me and known me. You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off.

You comprehend my path and my lying down, And are acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word on my tongue, But behold, O Lord, You know it altogether.

You have hedged me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain it.

Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? If I ascend into heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there.

If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, Even there Your hand shall lead me, And Your right hand shall hold me.

If I say, "Surely the darkness shall fall on me," Even the night shall be light about me; Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You, But the night shines as the day; The darkness and the light are both alike to You.

For You have formed my inward parts; You have covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Marvelous are Your works, And that my soul knows very well.

Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me, and know my anxieties; And see if there is any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.

<string>725 God Works For Good
Romans 8, N.I.V.

I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.

The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.

For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.

And we know that in all things God works for me good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.

What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?

He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all-- how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?

<string>726 The Lord Is My Shepherd
Psalm 23, K.J.V.

The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

<string>727 The Lord Is My Light
Psalm 27, N.K.J.V.

The Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?

When the wicked came against me To eat up my flesh, My enemies and foes, They stumbled and fell.

Though an army should encamp against me, My heart shall not fear; Though war should rise against me, In this I will be confident.

One thing I have desired of the Lord, That will I seek: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord All the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the Lord, And to inquire in His temple.

For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock.

And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me; Therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord.

When my father and my mother forsake me, Then the Lord will take care of me.

Teach me Your way, O Lord, And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies.

Wait on the Lord; Be of good courage, And He shall strengthen your heart; Wait, I say, on the Lord!

<string>728 Let The Redeemed Thank The Lord
Psalm 107, R.S.V.

Let [the redeemed] thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!... And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!

Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters; they saw the deeds of the Lord, his wondrous works in the deep.

For he commanded, and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea.

They mounted up to heaven, they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight; they reeled and staggered like drunken men, and were at their wits' end.

Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress; he made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.

Then they were glad because they had quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven. Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.

He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground, a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.

He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water. And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in; they sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get a fruitful yield.

Whoever is wise, let him give heed to these things; let men consider the steadfast love of the Lord.

<string>729 The Saviour Is Coming
Isaiah 40, N.K.J.V.

"Comfort, yes, comfort My people!" Says your God. "Speak comfort to Jerusalem, and cry out to her, That her warfare is ended, That her iniquity is pardoned; For she has received from the Lord's hand Double for all her sins."

The voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord; Make straight in the desert A highway for our God.

"Every valley shall be exalted, And every mountain and hill shall be made low; The crooked places shall be made straight, And the rough places smooth;

"The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, And all flesh shall see it together; For the mouth of the Lord has spoken."

O Zion, You who bring good tidings, Get up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, You who bring good tidings, Lift up your voice with strength, Lift it up, be not afraid; Say to the cities of Judah, "Behold your God!"

Behold, the Lord God shall come with a strong hand, And His arm shall rule for Him; Behold, His reward is with Him, And His work before Him.

He will feed I His flock like a shepherd; He will gather the lambs with His arm, And carry them in His bosom, And gently lead those who are with young.

<string>730 The Birth Of Christ
Matthew 1 and Luke 2, N.I.V.

This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.

His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.

An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

"She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."

And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.

But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.

"Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger."

Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."

<string>731 The Visit Of The Wise Men
Matthew 2, R.S.V.

Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying,

"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and have come to worship him."

When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it is written by the prophet: 'And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will govern my people Israel.'"

Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star appeared; and he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him bring me word, that I too may come and worship him."

When they had heard the king they went their way; and lo, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the child was.

When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy; and going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him.

Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

<string>732 Jesus' Prayer For His Disciples
John 17, N.I.V.

"Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you."

"Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."

"I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word."

"I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.... Glory has come to me through them."

"Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name-- the name you gave me-- so that they may be one as we are one."

"I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them."

"My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.

"Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.

"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you."

"May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.

"Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world."
</string>

<string>733 Christ's Sufferings And Death-I
Isaiah 53, N.I.V.

Who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?

He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.

He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted.

But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.

We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.

By oppression and judgment, he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken.

He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.

Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the Lord makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.

After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.

Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

<string>734 Christ's Sufferings And Death-II
Matthew 27, N.I.V.

Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death. They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.

"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked. They all answered, "Crucify him!" "Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"

Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.

They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then wove a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, King of the Jews!" they said.

They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.

And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.

At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.

When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!"
</string>

<string>735 The Resurrection Of Jesus
Matthew 28, N.I.V.

After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.

There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.

His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.

"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.... Go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead.'"

So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said.

They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.
</string>

<string>736 The Glorified Christ
Mark 16, 1 Corinthians 15, and Revelation 1, N.I.V.

After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.

If Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.... But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.

Among the lampstands was someone "like a son of man," dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.

In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.

When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said:

"Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades."
</string>

<string>737 The Ascension
Acts 1, N.E.B.

[Jesus] showed himself to these men after his death, and gave ample proof that he was alive: over a period of forty days he appeared to them and taught them about the kingdom of God.

While he was in their company he told them not to leave Jerusalem. "You must wait," he said, "for the promise made by my Father, about which you have heard me speak:

"John, as you know, baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit, and within the next few days."

So, when they were all together, they asked him, "Lord, is this the time when you are to establish once again the sovereignty of Israel?"

He answered, "It is not for you to know about dates or times, which the Father has set within his own control. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will bear witness for me in Jerusalem, and all over Judaea and Samaria, and away to the ends of the earth."

When he had said this, as they watched, he was lifted up, and a cloud removed him from their sight. As he was going, and as they were gazing intently into the sky, all at once there stood beside them two men in white who said,

"Men of Galilee, why stand there looking up into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken away from you up to heaven, will come in the same way as you have seen him go."
</string>

<string>738 Our Understanding Priest
Hebrews 2, 4, and 6, N.I.V.

We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.

For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.

Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.

Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.... Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure.
</string>

<string>739 Christ's Priesthood
Hebrews 8 and 9, R.S.V.

Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord.

For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.

Now 'if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.

But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the Holy Place, taking not the blood of goats and calves but his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.

For Christ has entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.

Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the Holy Place yearly with blood not his own; for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world.

But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.

<string>740 Christ The Deliverer
Isaiah 43, N.I.V.

This is what the Lord says- he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: "Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are mine.

"When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.

"For I am the Lord, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.... Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give men in exchange for you, and people in exchange for your life.

"Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west. I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 'Do not hold them back.'

"Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth- everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."

<string>741 The Shepherd Cares For His People
Ezekiel 34, N.E.B.

These are the words of the Lord God: Now I myself will ask after my sheep and go in search of them.

As a shepherd goes in search of his sheep when his Hock is dispersed all around him, so I will go in search of my sheep and rescue them, no matter where they were scattered in dark and cloudy days.

I will bring them out from every nation, gather them in from other lands, and lead them home to their own soil.

I will graze them on the mountains of Israel, by her streams and in all her green fields. I will feed them on good grazing-ground, and their pasture shall be the high mountains of Israel.

There they will rest, there in good pasture, and find rich grazing on the mountains of Israel.

I myself will tend my flock, I myself pen them in their fold, says the Lord God.

I will search for the lost, recover the straggler, bandage the hurt, strengthen the sick, leave the healthy and strong to play, and give them their proper food.
</string>

<string>742 The Lord Works Justice
Psalm 1O3, R.S.V.

The Lord works vindication and justice for all who are oppressed.

He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel.

As far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.

As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear him. For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.

As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.

But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children, to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.

The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.

Bless the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word!

Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will!

Bless the Lord, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless the Lord, O my soul!

<string>743 Seeking The Lost (RR)
Luke 15, N.A.S.B.

"What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture, and go after the one which is lost, until he finds it?"

"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'

"I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.

"Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?

"And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for 1 have found the coin which I had lost!'

"In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."
</string>

<string>744 The Good Shepherd
John 10, Jerusalem

"I tell you most solemnly, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold through the gate, but gets in some other way is a thief and a brigand.

"The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the flock; the gatekeeper lets him in, the sheep hear his voice, one by one he calls his own sheep and leads them out.

"When he has brought out his flock, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow because they know his voice.

"They never follow a stranger but run away from him: they do not recognize the voice of strangers."

"I tell you most solemnly, I am the gate of the sheepfold. All others who have come are thieves and brigands; but the sheep took no notice of them.

"I am the gate. Anyone who enters through me will be safe: he will go freely in and out and be sure of finding pasture.

"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it to the full.

"I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd is one who lays down his life for his sheep.

"The hired man, since he is not the shepherd and the sheep do not belong to him, abandons the sheep and runs away as soon as he sees a wolf coming, and then the wolf attacks and scatters the sheep; this is because he is only a hired man and has no concern for the sheep.

"I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for my sheep.

"And there are other sheep I have that are not of this fold, and these I have to lead as well. They too will listen to my voice, and there will be only one flock, and one shepherd."
</string>

<string>745 The Christian's Assurance

1 John 5, Colossians 1, Galatians 4, and Romans 8, N.I.V.

This is the assurance we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.

For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit, who calls out, "Abba, Father." So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir.

What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?

Christ Jesus, who died more than that, who was raised to life is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?

As it is written: "For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered." No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<string>746 Signs Of Christ's Coming
Matthew 24, Jerusalem

When [Jesus] was sitting on the Mount of Olives the disciples came and asked him privately, "Tell us, when is this going to happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world?"

And Jesus answered them, "Take care that no one deceives you; because many will come using my name and saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will deceive many.

"You will hear of wars and rumors of wars; do not be alarmed, for this is something that must happen, but the end will not be yet. For nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes here and there.... Then they will hand you over to be tortured and put to death; and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name."

"This Good News of the kingdom will be proclaimed to the whole world as a witness to all the nations. And then the end will come."

"There will be great distress such as, until now, since the world began, there never has been, nor ever will be again... False Christs and false prophets will arise and produce great signs and portents, enough to deceive even the chosen, if that were possible. There, I have forewarned you."

"Immediately after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened, the moon will lose its brightness, the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of heaven will be shaken.

"And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven; then too all the peoples of the earth will beat their breasts; and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

"And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet to gather his chosen from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."

<string>747 Christ's Second Coming
John 14, Acts 1, and Matthew 24 K.J.V.

Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.

In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

While they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said,

Ye men of Galilee, Why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.

But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.

Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.

Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?

Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing.

<string>748 Reward Of The Saints
Isaiah 35, N.I.V.

The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus, it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy.

The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God.

Strengthen the feeble hands, steady the knees that give way; say to those with fearful hearts, "Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you."

Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb shout for joy.

Water will gush forth in the wilderness and Streams in the desert. The burning sand will become a pool, the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay, grass and reeds and papyrus will grow.

And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not journey on it; it will be for those who walk in that Way; wicked fools will not go about on it.

No lion will be there, nor will any ferocious beast get up on it; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there, and the ransomed of the Lord will return.

They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.

<string>749 A Song Of Triumph
Revelation 7, N.I.V.

I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.

And they cried out in a loud voice: "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."

All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, saying:

"Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!"

Then one of the elders asked me, "These in white robes who are they, and where did they come from?" I answered, "Sir, you know." And he said, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore,

"they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.

"Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat upon them, nor any scorching heat.

"For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."

<string>750 Reigning Forever With God
Revelation 21 and 22, N.K.J.V.

"I am the Alpha and the Omega, The beginning and the end. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts.

"He who overcomes shall inherited all thins, and I will be his God and he shall be My son."

And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb.

In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him. They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.

And there shall be no night there, they need no lamp for light of the sun, for the Lord god gives them light, And they shall reign forever and ever.

<string>751 O Lord Thou Art My God
Isaiah 25, K.J.V.

O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.

Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.

And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

John 14, 15, and 16, R.S.V.

"I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you for ever,

"even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him, for he dwells with you, and will be in you.

"I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you."

"Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you."

And when he comes, he will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:

"concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged."

"When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.

"He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you."

"But when the Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father,... he will bear witness to me."

"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, be will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you."

Psalm 119, Jerusalem

How can a youth remain pure? By behaving as your word prescribes.

I have sought you with all my heart, do not let me stray from your commandments.

I have treasured your promises in my heart, since I have no wish to sin against you.

How blessed are you, Yahweh! Teach me your statutes!

With my lips I have repeated them, all these rulings from your own mouth.

In the way of your decrees lies my joy, a joy beyond all wealth.

I mean to meditate on your precepts and to concentrate on your paths.

I find my delight in your statutes, I do not forget your word.

Open my eyes: I shall concentrate on the marvels of your Law.

Now your word is a lamp to my feet, a light to my path.

As your word unfolds, it gives light, and the simple understand.

Faithfulness is the essence of your word, your righteous rulings bold good for ever.

<string>754 The Holy Scriptures
Deuteronomy 29, 2 Peter 1, 2 Timothy 3, John 5, Hebrews 4, and Jeremiah 15, N.K.J.V.

The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our' children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.

We also have the prophetic word made more sure, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;

knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.

From childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.

"You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me."

The word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

Your words were found, and I ate them, And Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart.

<string>755 The Call
Isaiah 55, Jerusalem

Oh, come to the water all you who are thirsty; though you have no money, come! Buy corn without money, and eat, and, at no cost, wine and milk. Why spend money on what is not bread, your wages on what fails to satisfy?

Listen, listen to me, and you will have good things to eat and rich food to enjoy. Pay attention, come to me; listen, and your soul will live.

With you I will make an everlasting covenant out of the favours promised to David. See, I have made of you a witness to the peoples, a leader and a master of the nations.

See, you will summon a nation you never knew, those unknown will come hurrying to you, for the sake of Yahweh your God, of the Holy One of Israel who will glorify you.

Seek Yahweh while he is still to be found, call to him while he is still near. Let the wicked man abandon his way, the evil man his thoughts.

Let him turn back to Yahweh who will take pity on him, to our God who is rich in forgiving; for my thoughts are not your thoughts, my ways not your ways it is Yahweh who speaks.

Yes, the heavens are as high above earth as my ways are above your ways, my thoughts above your thoughts.

<string>756 Have Mercy On Me O God
Psalm 51, N.I.V.

Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.

For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.

Surely I have been a sinner from birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place.

Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.

Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity.

Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.

Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you. Save me from blood guilt, O God, the God who saves me; and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.

O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. You do not delight in sacrifice or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.

The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

<string>757 Returning To God
Luke 15, N.E.B.

[Jesus] said: "There was once a man who had two sons; and the younger said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the property.' So he divided his estate between them.

"A few days later the younger son turned the whole of his share into cash and left home for a distant country, where he squandered it in reckless living.

"He had spent it all, when a severe famine fell upon that country and he began to feel the pinch. So he went and attached himself to one of the local landowners, who sent him on to his farm to mind the pigs.

"He would have been glad to fill his belly with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything.

"Then he came to his senses and said, 'How many of my father's paid servants have more food than they can eat, and here am I, starving to death!

"'I will set off and go to my father, and say to him, "Father, I have sinned, against God and against you; I am no longer lit to be called your son; treat me as one of your paid servants."' So he set out for his father's house.

"But while he was still a long way off his father saw him, and his heart went out to him. He ran to meet him, flung his arms round him, and kissed him.

"The son said, 'Father, I have sinned, against God and against you; I am no longer lit to be called your son.'

"But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! fetch a robe, my best one, and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet. Bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us have a feast to celebrate the day. For this son of mine was dead and has come back to life; he was lost and is found.'

"And the festivities began."

<string>758 Blessed Is He Whose Transgressions Are Forgiven
Psalm 32, N.I.V.

Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.

When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.

Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord" and you forgave the guilt of my sin.

Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him. You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance.

I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.

<string>759 Baptism
John 3, 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 6, and Matthew 28, R.S.V.

Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."

By one spirit we were all baptized into one body Jews or Greeks, slaves or free and all were made to drink of one Spirit.

Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.

For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.

We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For he who has died is freed from sin.

"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you;

"and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."
</string>

<string>760 Times Of Beginning
Genesis 1, John 1, Romans 3, 2 Corinthians 5, and Isaiah 65, N.I.V.

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth....' God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

In him was life, and that life was the light of men. The Word became flesh' and lived for a while among us.

We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.

Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!

"Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth. Be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create."
</string>

<string>761 Righteousness By Faith
Romans 3, 8, and 1 Corinthians 1, N.I.V.

Righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.

God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished-

he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies the man who has faith in Jesus.

Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.

What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?

He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all-how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?

Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.

It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God-that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.
</string>

<string>762 Justification
Romans 4 and 5, N.I.V.

[Jesus] was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.

Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.

And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.

And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.

You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.

But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!

For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!

Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
</string>

<string>763 Sanctification
1 Corinthians 6, Hebrews 2, and Titus 3 N.I.V.

Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived:

Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.

And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.

Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good, to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and to show true humility toward all men.

At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.

But when the kindness and love of God our Savior 'appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.

He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.
</string>

<string>764 Reconciliation
2 Corinthians 5, T.E.V.

We are ruled by the love of Christ, now that we recognize that one man died for everyone, which means that they all share in his death.

He died for all, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but only for him who died and was raised to life for their sake.

No longer, then, do we judge anyone by human standards. Even if at one time we judged Christ according to human standards, we no longer do so.

When anyone is joined to Christ, he is a new being; the old is gone, the new has come.

All this is done by God, who through Christ changed us from enemies into his friends and gave us the task of making others his friends also.

Our message is that God was making all mankind his friends through Christ. God did not keep an account of their sins, and he has given us the message which tells how he makes them his friends.

Here we are, then, speaking for Christ, as though God himself were making his appeal through us. We plead on Christ's behalf: let God change you from enemies into his friends!

Christ was without sin, but for our sake God made him share our sin in order that in union with him we might share the righteousness of God.
</string>

<string>765 Conversion
Ephesians 2, N.E.B.

Time was when you were dead in your sins and wickedness, when you followed the evil ways of this present age, when you obeyed the commander of the spiritual powers of the air, the spirit now at work among God's rebel subjects.

We too were once of their number: we all lived our lives in sensuality, and obeyed the promptings of our own instincts and notions.

In our natural condition we, like the rest, lay under the dreadful judgement of God. But God, rich in mercy, for the great love he bore us, brought us to life with Christ even when we were dead in our sins; it is by his grace you are saved.

And in union with Christ Jesus he raised us up and enthroned us with him in the heavenly realms, so that he might display in the ages to come how immense are the resources of his grace, and how great his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.

For it is by his grace you are saved, through trusting him; it is not your own doing. It is God's gift, not a reward for work done.

There is nothing for anyone to boast of. For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to devote ourselves to the good deeds for which God has designed us.

<string>766 The Great Controversy
Revelation 12 and 11, R.S.V.

Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.

And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world-he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.

And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.

"And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death.

"Rejoice then, O heaven and you that dwell therein! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!"

And there were loud voices in heaven, saying "The kingdom of the world bas become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and be shall reign for ever and ever."
</string>

<string>767 The Body Of Christ
Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12, N.I.V.

Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, So in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.

We were all baptized by one Spirit into one body-whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free-and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.

Now the body is not made up of one part but of many.... In fact God has arranged the parts in the body, everyone of them, just as he wanted them to be. If they were all one part, where would the body be? As it is, there are many parts, but one body.

The eye cannot say to the band, "I don't need you!" And the bead cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!" On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weak, are indispensable

There should be no division in the body, but... its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.

Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.

1 Peter 2, Titus 2, and Matthew 28, N.K.J.V.

You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.

For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age,

looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,

<string>769 The Sabbath-1
Genesis 2, Colossians 1, Nehemiah 9, Exodus 2O, and Mark 2, N.K.J.V.

Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished.

And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.

Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.

By [Christ] all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.

You alone are the Lord; You have made heaven, The heaven of heavens, with all their host, The earth and all things on it, The seas and all that is in them, And You preserve them all. The host of heaven worships You.... You made known to them Your holy Sabbath.

"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God.

"In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates.

"For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."

[Jesus] said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."
</string>

<string>770 The Sabbath-2
Ezekiel 20, Exodus 31, Isaiah 66, 58, Luke 4, and Matthew 12, N.I.V.

"Keep my Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God."

"'[The Sabbath] will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested.'"

"As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me," declares the Lord, "so will your name and descendants endure.

"From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me," says the Lord.

"If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the Lord's holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words,

"then you will find your joy in the Lord, and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob." The mouth of the Lord has spoken.

[Jesus] went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom.

He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good in the Sabbath!"

<string>771 Living Bread
John 6, N.E.B.

Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall never be hungry, and whoever believes in me shall never be thirsty. But you, as I said, do not believe although you have seen.

"All that the Father gives me will come to me, and the man who comes to me I will never turn away. I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. It is his will that I should not lose even one of all that he has given me, but raise them all up on the last day.

"For it is my Father's will that everyone who looks upon the Son and puts his faith in him shall possess eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day."

"In truth, in very truth I tell you, the believer possesses eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert and they are dead. I am speaking of the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat, and never die.

"I am that living bread which has come down from heaven; if anyone eats this bread he shall live for ever. Moreover, the bread which I will give is my own flesh; I give it for the life of the world."

This led to a fierce dispute among the Jews. "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" they said.

Jesus replied, "In truth, in very truth I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you can have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood possesses eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. My flesh is real food; my blood is real drink.

"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells continually in me and I dwell in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me shall live because of me. This is the bread which came down from heaven; and it is not like the bread which our fathers ate: they are dead, but whoever eats this bread shall live for ever."

<string>772 Memorial Of Humility
John 13, N.I.V.

Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.

He got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?" Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand." "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet."

Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."

"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"

Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean."

When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place.

"Do you understand what I have done for your" he asked them.

"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am.

"Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you."

"Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them."

<string>773 The Lord's Supper
1 Corinthians 11, N.K.J.V.

I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you:

that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread: and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said,

"Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me."

In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying,

"This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me."

For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death till He comes.

Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.

<string>774 The Law Of The Lord Is Perfect
Psalm 19, N.K.J.V.

The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple;

The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

More to be desired are they than gold, Yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them Your servant is warned, And in keeping them there is great reward.

Who can understand his errors? Cleanse me from secret faults. Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me. Then I shall be blameless, And I shall be innocent of great transgression.

Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.
</string>

<string>775 The Ten Commandments
Exodus 2O, K.J.V.

God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:

Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy, Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day:

wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

Thou shalt not kill.

Thou shalt not commit adultery.

Thou shalt not steal.

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

<string>776 Gifts Of The Spirit
1 Corinthians 12, N.I.V.

Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.

There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men.

Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit;

to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous powers,

to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another the ability to speak in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.

All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each man, just as he determines.

The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body.

So it is with Christ.
</string>

<string>777 Christian Unity
Ephesians 4, N.I.V.

As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.

Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

There is one body and one Spirit-just as you were called to one hope when you were called-one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.

But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says: "When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men."

It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,

To prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.

Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
</string>

<string>778 Our Atoning Judge
Romans 14 and 1 John 2, N.I.V.

Why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat.

It is written: "'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'Every knee will bow before me; every tongue will confess to God.'"

So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.

My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin.

But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense-Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.

He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
</string>

<string>779 Day Of Judgment
Daniel 7 and Revelation 20 through 22, Jerusalem.

"Thrones were set in place and one of great age took his seat. His robe was white as snow, the hair of his head as pure as wool. His throne was a blaze of flames, its wheels were a burning fire.

"A stream of fire poured out, issuing from his presence. A thousand thousand waited on him, ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. A court was held and the books were opened."

I saw the dead, both great and small, standing in front of his throne, while the book of life was opened, and other books opened which were the record of what they had done in their lives, by which the dead were judged.

Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; the first heaven and the first earth had disappeared now, and there was no longer any sea.

I saw the holy city, and the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven as beautiful as a bride all dressed for her husband.

"Here God lives among men. He will make his home among them; they shall be his people, and he will be their God; his name is God-with-them."

"Very soon now, I shall be with you again, bringing the reward to be given to every man according to what he deserves."
</string>

<string>780 The Three Angels' Messages
Revelation 14, K.J.V.

I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice,

Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,

the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and of his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
</string>

<string>781 The Resurrection Of God's People
Romans 14, 1 Corinthians 15, and 1 Thessalonians 4, R.S.V.

To this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.

If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied. But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.

For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.

For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, shall not precede those who have fallen asleep.

For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first;

then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.

Lo! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised in perishable, and we shall be changed.

Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

<string>782 Assurance Of Eternal Life
John 3, 1O, and 1 John 5, Jerusalem.

"Yes, God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost but may have eternal life.

"For God sent his Son into the world not to condemn the world, but so that through him the world might be saved."

"The sheep that belong to me listen to my voice; I know them and they follow me. I give them eternal life; they will never be lost and no one will steal them from me.

"The Father who gave them to me is greater than anyone, and no one can steal from the Father. The Father and I are one."

This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life and this life is in his Son; anyone who has the Son has life, anyone who does not have the Son does not have life.

I have written all this to you so that you who believe in the name of the Son of God may be sure that you have eternal life.
</string>

<string>783 A New Heaven And A New Earth
Revelation 21, N.K.J.V.

I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea.

Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.

"And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying; and there shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away."

Then He who sat on the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And He said to me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful."
</string>

<string>784 Blessed Is The Man
Psalm 1, R.S.V.

Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;

but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.

He is like a tree planted by streams of water, that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.

The wicked are not so, but are like chaff which the wind drives away.

Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;

for the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
</string>

<string>785 The Earth Is The Lord's
Psalm 24, R.S.V.

The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein;

for He has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the rivers.

Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in his holy place?

He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false, and does not swear deceitfully.

He will receive blessing from the Lord, and vindication from the God of his salvation. Such is the generation of those who seek him, who Seek the face of the God of Jacob.

Lift up your heads, O gates! and be lifted up, O ancient doors! that the King of glory may come in.

Who is the King of glory?

The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, mighty ill battle! Lift up your heads, O gates! and be lifted up, O ancient doors! that the King of glory may come in,

Who is this King of glory?

The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory!
</string>

<string>786 The New Life
Romans 6, T.E.V.

What shall we say, then? Should we continue to live in sin so that God's grace will increase?

Certainly not! We have died to sin-how then can we go on living in it? For when a person dies, he is set free from the power of sin.

Since we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For we know that Christ has been raised from death and will never die again death will no longer rule over him.

And so, because he died, sin has no power over him; and now he lives his life in fellowship with God. In the same way you are to think of yourselves as dead, so far as sin is concerned, but living in fellowship with God through Christ Jesus.

Sin must no longer rule in your mortal bodies, so that you obey the desires of your natural self. Nor must you surrender any part of yourselves to sin to be used for wicked purposes.

Instead, give yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life, and surrender your whole being to him to be used for righteous purposes. Sin must not be your master; for you do not live under law but under God's grace.

What, then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law but under God's grace? By no means!

Now you have been set free from sin and are the slaves of God. Your gain is a life fully dedicated to him, and the result is eternal life.

For sin pays its wage-death; but God's free gift is eternal life in union with Christ Jesus our Lord.

<string>787 Christianity In Practice
Romans 12, R.S.V.

Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good; love one another with brotherly affection; outdo one another in showing honor.

Never flag in zeal, but aglow with the Spirit, serve the Lord.

Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.

Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.

Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; never be conceited.

Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends upon you, live peaceably with all.

Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God; for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."

No, "if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head."

Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
</string>

<string>788 Love
1 Corinthians 13, N.K.J.V.

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.

And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.

Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up;

does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil;

does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away.

For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.

When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.

And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
</string>

<string>789 Growing In Christ (Sanctification)
Colossians 3, Jerusalem

Since you have been brought back to true life with Christ, you must look for the things that are in heaven, where Christ is, sitting at God's right hand.

Let your thoughts be on heavenly things, not on the things that are on the earth, because you have died, and now the life you have is hidden with Christ in God.

But when Christ is revealed-and he is your life-you too will be revealed in all your glory with him.

That is why you must kill everything in you that belongs only to earthly life: fornication, impurity, guilty passion, evil desires and especially greed, which is the same thing as worshipping a false god; all this is the sort of behaviour that makes God angry.

And it is the way in which you used to live when you were surrounded by people doing the same thing, but now you, of all people, must give all these things up: getting angry, being bad-tempered, spitefulness, abusive language and dirty talk; and never tell each other lies.

You have stripped off your old behaviour with your old self, and you have put on a new self which will progress towards true knowledge the more it is renewed in the image of its creator;

and in that image there is no room for distinction between Greek and Jew, between the circumcised or the uncircumcised, or between barbarian and Scythian, slave and free man.

There is only Christ: he is everything and he is in everything.
</string>

<string>790 The Children Of God
1 John 3, R.S.V.

See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.

Beloved, we are God's children now; it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every one who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.

Every one who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.

No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does right is righteous, as he is righteous.

He who commits sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.

No one born of God commits sin; for God's nature abides in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God.

By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother.

For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

<string>791 Set Your Mind On God's Kingdom
Matthew 6, N.E.B.

"No servant can be the slave of two masters; for either he will hate the first and love the second, or he will be devoted to the first and think nothing of the second. You cannot serve God and Money.

"Therefore I bid you put away anxious thoughts about food and drink to keep you alive, and clothes to cover your body. Surely life is more than food, the body more than clothes.

"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow and reap and store in barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. You are worth more than the birds!

"Is there a man of you who by anxious thought can add a foot to his height? And why be anxious about clothes?

"Consider how the lilies grow in the fields; they do not work, they do not spin; and yet, I tell you, even Solomon in all his splendour was not attired like one of these.

"But if that is how God clothes the grass in the fields, which is there today, and tomorrow is thrown on the stove, will he not all the more clothe you?

"How little faith you have! No, do not ask anxiously, 'What are we to eat? What are we to drink? What shall we wear?'

"All these are things for the heathen to run after, not for you, because your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.

"Set your mind on God's kingdom and his justice before every thing else, and all the rest will come to you as well."

I will bless the Lord who has given me counsel; My heart also instructs me in the night seasons.

I have set the Lord always before me; Because He is at my right hand I shall not be moved.

Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will rest in hope.

For You will not leave my soul in Sheol, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.

You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine in the heart of your house; your sons shall be like olive-shoots round about your table.

This is the blessing in store for the man who fears the Lord.

May the Lord bless you from Zion; may you share the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life, and live to see your children's children!

Proverbs 3, Jerusalem

Happy the man who discovers wisdom, the man who gains discernment:

Her ways are delightful ways, her paths all lead to contentment.

She is a tree of life for those who hold her fast, those who cling to her live happy lives.

<string>795 The Christian Life
Matthew 5, N.I.V.

"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

"Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.

"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.

"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.

"Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.

"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.

"In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven."
</string>

<string>796 Hope And Comfort
Isaiah 41, Psalm 33, and Romans 5, 15, Jerusalem

Do not be afraid, for I am with you; stop being anxious and watchful, for I am your God. I give you strength, I bring you help, I uphold you with my victorious right hand.

The eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him, on those who rely on his love, to rescue their souls from death and keep them alive in famine.

It is by faith and through Jesus that we have entered this state of grace in which we can boast about looking forward to God's glory.

But that is not all we can boast about; we can boast about our sufferings. These sufferings bring patience, as we know, and patience brings perseverance, and perseverance brings hope,

and this hope is not deceptive, because the love of God has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given us.

May the God of hope bring you such joy and peace in your faith that the power of the Holy Spirit will remove all bounds to hope.

<string>797 Meditation
Joshua 1 and Psalms 119, 19, R.S.V.

I have laid up thy word in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.... I will meditate on thy precepts, and fix my eyes on thy ways.

I will delight in thy statutes; I will not forget thy word.... I revere thy commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on thy statutes.

I remember thy name in the night, O Lord, and keep thy law.... Oh, how I love thy law! It is my meditation all the day.

Thy commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me. I have more understanding than all my teachers, for thy testimonies are my meditation.

I rise before dawn and cry for help; I hope in thy words. My eyes are awake before the watches of the night, that I may meditate upon thy promise.

<string>798 Prayer
Matthew 6 and 7, Jerusalem

"When you pray, do not imitate the hypocrites: they love to say their prayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street corners for people to see them. I tell you solemnly, they have had their reward.

"But when you pray, go to your private room and, when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in that secret place, and your Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you.

"In your prayers do not babble as the pagans do, for they think that by using many words they will make themselves heard. Do not be like them; your Father knows what you need before you ask him."

"If you forgive others their failings, your heavenly Father will forgive you yours; but if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive your failings either."

"Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.

"For the one who asks always receives; the one who searches always finds; the one who knocks will always have the door opened to him.

"Is there a man among you who would hand his son a stone when he asked for bread? Or would hand him a snake when he asked for a fish?

"If you, then, who are evil, know how to give your children what is good, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!"

<string>799 Do Not Worry
Psalm 37, Jerusalem

Do not worry about the wicked, do not envy those who do wrong. Quick as the grass they wither, fading like the green in the field.

Trust in Yahweh and do what is good, make your home in the land and live in peace; make Yahweh your only joy and he will give you what your heart desires.

Commit your fate to Yahweh, trust in him and he will act: making your virtue clear as the light, your integrity as bright as noon.

Be quiet before Yahweh, and wait patiently for him, not worrying about men who make their fortunes, about men who scheme to bring the poor and needy down.

Enough of anger, leave rage aside, do not worry, nothing but evil can come of it: for the wicked will be expelled, while those who hope in Yahweh shall have the land for their own.

A little longer, and the wicked will be no more, search his place well, he will not be there: but the humble shall have the land for their own to enjoy untroubled peace.

<string>800 Union With Christ
John 15, N.A.S.B.

"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.

"Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it, that it may bear more fruit.

"You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.

"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me.

"I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.

"If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch, and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you.

"By this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples.

"Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love.

"If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love."

<string>801 I Waited Patiently For The Lord
Psalm 40, N.I.V.

I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.

He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.

Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.

Many, O Lord my God, are the wonders you have done. The things you planned for us no one can recount to you; were I to speak and tell of them, they would be too many to declare.

"To do your will, O my God, is my desire; your law is within my heart."... I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and salvation. I do not conceal your love and your truth from the great assembly.

Do not withhold your mercy from me, O Lord; may your love and your truth always protect me.
</string>

<string>802 Guidance
Psalms 119, 25, Isaiah 30, Psalm 32, and John 16, R.S.V.

Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord! Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart.

Put false ways far from me; and graciously teach me thy law! I have chosen the way of faithfulness, I set thy ordinances before me.

Lead me in the path of thy commandments, for I delight in it.... Turn my eyes from looking at vanities; and give me life in thy ways.

Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.

Good and upright is the Lord; therefore he instructs sinners in the way. He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way.

All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.

Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk in it," when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.

I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.

"When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come."

<string>803 Praise Is Rightfully Yours
Psalm 65, Jerusalem

Praise is rightfully yours, God, in Zion. Vows to you must be fulfilled, for you answer prayer.

All flesh must come to you with all its sins; though our faults overpower us, you blot them out.

Happy the man you choose, whom you invite to live in your courts. Fill us with the good things of your house, of your holy Temple.

Your righteousness repays us with marvels, God our savior, hope of all the ends of the earth and the distant islands.

Your strength holds the mountains up, such is the power that wraps you; you calm the clamour of the ocean, the clamour of its waves.

The nations are in uproar, in panic those who live at the ends of the world, as your miracles bring shouts of joy to the portals of morning and evening.

You visit the earth and water it, you load it with riches; God's rivers brim with water to provide their grain.

This is how you provide it: by drenching its furrows, by levelling its ridges, by softening it with showers, by blessing the first-fruits.

You crown the year with your bounty, abundance flows wherever you pass; the desert pastures overflow, the hillsides are wrapped in joy, the meadows are dressed in flocks, the valleys are clothed in wheat, what shouts of joy, what singing!
</string>

<string>804 A Prayer Of Confession
Daniel 9, T.E.V.

"Lord God, you are great, and we honor you. You are faithful to your covenant and show constant love to those who love you and do what you command.

"We have sinned, we have been evil, we have done wrong. We have rejected what you commanded us to do and have turned away from what you showed us was right.

"We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our rulers, our ancestors, and our whole nation.

"You, Lord, always do what is right, but we have always brought disgrace on ourselves.... You are merciful and forgiving, although we have rebelled against you.

"We did not listen to you, O Lord our God, when you told us to live according to the laws which you gave us through your servants the prophets.... You did what you said you would do to us and our rulers.... O Lord our God, we have not tried to please you by turning from our sins or by following your truth."

"O Lord our God, you showed your power by bringing your people out of Egypt, and your power is still remembered. We have sinned; we have done wrong."

"Listen to us, O God; look at us and see the trouble we are in and the suffering of the city that bears your name. We are praying to you because you are merciful, not because we have done right.

"Lord, hear us. Lord, forgive us. Lord, listen to us, and act! In order that everyone will know that you are God, do not delay! This city and these people are yours."

<string>805 Humility
Philippians 2, N.I.V.

If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,

then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.

Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, ...made himself nothing.

And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on a cross! 

Therefore, my dear friends,... continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.

Do everything without complaining or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe.
</string>

<string>806 Arise Shine
Isaiah 60, Jerusalem

Arise, shine out, for your light has come, the glory of Yahweh is rising on you, though night still covers the earth and darkness the peoples.

Above you Yahweh now rises and above you his glory appears. The nations come to your light and kings to your dawning brightness.

Lift up your eyes and look round: all are assembling and coming towards you, your sons from far away and your daughters being tenderly carried.

At this sight you will grow radiant, your heart throbbing and full; since the riches of the sea will flow to you, the wealth of the nations come to you.

Though you have been abandoned, and hated and shunned, I will make you an eternal pride, a joy for ever and ever.
</string>

<string>807 The Lord's Work
Isaiah 61, N.I.V.

The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.

He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release for the prisoners,

to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,

and provide for those who grieve in Zion-to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning,

and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.

I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.
</string>

<string>808 Doing Good To All
Galatians 6, N.I.V.

Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.

Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to some body else, for each one should carry his own load.

Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.

Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.

The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.

Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
</string>

<string>809 Christian Duties
1 Thessalonians 5, N.I.V.

Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work.

Live in peace with each other. And we urge you, brothers, warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone. Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.

Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.

Do not put out the Spirit's fire; do not treat prophecies with contempt. Test everything. Hold on to the good. Avoid every kind of evil.

May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</string>

<string>810 Work And Duty
Titus 3, 1 Timothy 6, 2 Corinthians 5, and Ecclesiastes 12, R.S.V.

Let our people learn to apply them selves to good deeds, so as to help cases of urgent need, and not to be unfruitful.

They are to do good, to be rich in good deeds, liberal and generous, thus laying up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life which is life indeed.

I desire you to insist on these things, so that those who have believe in God may be careful to apply themselves to good deeds; these are excellent and profitable to men.

We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the body.

Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.

For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.
</string>

<string>811 Peace
Psalm 133, 1 Corinthians 1, Romans 14, James 3, and 2 Corinthians 13, T.E.V.

How wonderful it is, how pleasant, for God's people to live together in harmony!

By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ I appeal to all of you, my brothers, to agree in what you say, so that there will be no divisions among you. Be completely united, with only one thought and one purpose.

So then, we must always aim at those things that bring peace and I that help strengthen one another.

The wisdom from above is pure first of all; it is also peaceful, gentle, and friendly; it is full of compassion and produces a harvest of good deeds; it is free from prejudice and hypocrisy.

And goodness is the harvest that is produced from the seeds the peacemakers plant in peace.

Strive for perfection; listen to my appeals; agree with one another; live in peace.

And the God of love and peace will be with you.
</string>

<string>812 Christian Relationships
Colossians 3, Jerusalem

You are God's chosen race, his saints; he loves you, and you should be clothed in sincere compassion, in kindness and humility, gentleness and patience.

Bear with one another; forgive each other as soon as a quarrel begins. The Lord has forgiven you; now you must do the same.

Over all these clothes, to keep them together and complete them, put on love. And may the peace of Christ reign in your hearts, because it is for this that you were called together as parts of one body. Always be thankful.

Let the message of Christ, in all its richness, find a home with you. Teach each other, and advise each other, in all wisdom. With gratitude in your hearts sing psalms and hymns and inspired songs to God;

and never say or do anything except in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
</string>

<string>813 Lord Who May Dwell In Your Sanctuary
Psalm 15, N.I.V.

Lord, who may dwell in your sanctuary? Who may live on your holy hill?

He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from his heart and has no slander on his tongue,

who does his neighbor no wrong and casts no slur on his fellow man, who despises a vile man but honors those who fear the Lord,

who keeps his oath even when it hurts, who lends his money without usury and does not accept a bribe against the innocent.

He who does these things will never be shaken.
</string>

<string>814 The Requirements Of God
Micah 6 and 7, and Hosea 14, N.I.V.

With what shall I come before the Lord and bow down before 'the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thou sands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.

Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?

You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.

Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God. Your sins have been your downfall! Take words with you and return to the Lord. Say to him:

"Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips."

"I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them."
</string>

<string>815 Watchfulness
Deuteronomy 4, Colossians 2, 1 Peter 5, 2 Thessalonians 2, and Mark 13, N.I.V.

Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen, or let them slip from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them.

Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the Lord your God has forbidden.

So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.

See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.

Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.

So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.

"Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come." "What I say to you, I say to every one: 'Watch!'"
</string>

<string>816 Preparation For Christ's Coming
1 Thessalonians 5, N.I.V.

You know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.

But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.

So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.

But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.

For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.

Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.
</string>

<string>817 Christian Warfare
Ephesians 6, T.E.V.

Finally, build up your strength in union with the Lord and by means of his mighty power. Put on all the armor that God gives you, so that you will be able to stand up against the Devil's evil tricks.

For we are not fighting against human beings but against the wicked spiritual forces in the heavenly world, the rulers, authorities, and cosmic powers of this dark age.

So put on God's armor now! Then when the evil day comes, you will be able to resist the enemy's attacks, and after fighting to the end, you will still hold your ground.

So stand ready, with truth as a belt tight around your waist, with righteousness as your breastplate, and as your shoes the readiness to announce the Good News of peace.

At all times carry faith as a shield; for with it you will be able to put out all the burning arrows shot by the Evil One. And accept salvation as a helmet, and the word of God as the sword which the Spirit gives you.

Do all this in prayer, asking for God's help. Pray on every occasion, as the Spirit leads. For this reason keep alert and never give up; pray always for all God's people.

<string>818 When The Lord Brought Back The Captives
Psalm 126, N.I.V.

When the Lord brought back the captives to Zion, we were like men who dreamed. Our mouths were filled with laughter our tongue with songs of joy.

Then it was said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them." The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.

Restore our fortunes, O Lord, like streams in the Negev.

Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy. He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him.
</string>

<string>819 I Cry Aloud To The Lord
Psalm 142, N.I.V.

I cry aloud to the Lord; I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy. I pour out my complaint before him; before him I tell my trouble. When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who know my way.

In the path where I walk men have hidden a snare for me. Look to my right and see; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life.

I cry to you, O Lord; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living." Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.

Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.
</string>

<string>820 Tithes And Offerings
Leviticus 27 and Malachi 3, N.K.J.V.

"'All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's. It is holy to the Lord.'"

"Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, 'In what way have we robbed You.' In tithes and offerings.

"You are cursed with a curse, For you have robbed Me, Even this whole nation.

"Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, That there may be food in My house, And prove Me now in this," says the Lord of hosts, "If I will not open for you the windows of heaven And pour out for you such blessing That there will not be room enough to receive it.

"And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, So that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground, Nor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in the field."

"And all nations will call you blessed, For you will be a delightful land," Says the Lord of hosts.
</string>

<string>821 Generosity
2 Corinthians 8 and 9, N.I.V.

See that you ... excel in this grace of giving.... For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.

If the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.

Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.

Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.

And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.

Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.

You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.

This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.

Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.

And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you. Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
</string>

<string>822 Our Daily Work
Genesis 2, 3, Exodus 20, Ecclesiastes 5, 9, 2 Thessalonians 3, 1 Timothy 5, and Romans 12, N.I.V.

The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.

Six days you shall labor and do all your work.

"By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food."

The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much.

Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.

We gave you this rule: "If a man will not work, he shall not eat."

If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.
</string>

<string>823 Temperance
Titus 2, Proverbs 20, 23, and 1 Corinthians 9, R.S.V.

Teach what befits sound doctrine. Bid the older men be temperate, serious, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.

Bid the older women likewise to be reverent in behavior, not to be slanderers or slaves to drink; they are to teach what is good, and so train the young women to love their husbands and children.... Likewise urge the younger men to control themselves.

Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; and whoever is led astray by it is not wise.

Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? Those who tarry long over wine, those who go to try mixed wine.

Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly. At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.

Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.

For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all men, training us to renounce irreligion and worldly passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world,

awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory Of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.
</string>

<string>824 Healthful Living
3 John, 1 Corinthians 6, 10, and Philippians 4, Jerusalem

My dear friend, I hope everything is going happily with you and that you are as well physically as you are spiritually.

Your body, you know, is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you since you received him from God. You are not your own property; you have been bought and paid for. That is why you should use your body for the glory of God.

Whatever you cat, whatever you drink, whatever you do at all, do it for the glory of God.

There is no need to worry; but if there is anything you need, pray for it, asking God for it with prayer and thanksgiving, and that peace of God, which is so much greater than we can understand, will guard your hearts and your thoughts, in Christ Jesus.

Finally, brothers, fill your minds with everything that is true, everything that is noble, everything that is good and pure, everything that we love and honour, and everything that can be thought virtuous or worthy of praise.
</string>

<string>825 Our Civic Duties
Romans 13, N.I.V.

Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.

The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.

For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you.

For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.

Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.

This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect, if honor, then honor.

Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law.
</string>

<string>826 Family Life
Deuteronomy 6 and Ephesians 6, N.I.V.

Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.

These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts.

Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.

Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.

"Honor your father and mother" which is the first commandment with a promise "that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth."

Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
</string>

<string>827 The Christian Home
Ephesians 4 and 5, Jerusalem

Never have grudges against others, or lose your temper, or raise your voice to anybody, or call each other names, or allow any sort of spitefulness.

Be friends with one another, and kind, forgiving each other as readily as God forgave you in Christ.

Try, then, to imitate God, as children of his that he loves, and follow Christ by loving as he loved you, giving himself up in our place as a fragrant offering and a sacrifice to God.

Among you there must be not even a mention of fornication or impurity in any of its forms, or promiscuity: this would hardly become the saints!

There must be no coarseness, or salacious talk and jokes-all this is wrong for you; raise your voices in thanksgiving instead.

You were darkness once, but now you are light in the Lord; be like children of light.

Sing the words and tunes of the psalms and hymns when you are together, and go on singing and chanting to the Lord in your hearts,

so that always and everywhere you are giving thanks to God who is our Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</string>

<string>828 Youth
Ecclesiastes 12, Proverbs 20, Psalm 119, Proverbs 3, and Psalm 103, N.I.V.

Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, "I find no pleasure in them."

Even a child is known by his actions, by whether his conduct is pure and right.

How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word. I seek you with all my heart; do not let me stray from your commands.

My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity.

Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.

Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.

Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.... He satisfies my desires with good things, so that my youth is renewed like the eagle's.
</string>

<string>829 A Noble Wife
Proverbs 31, N.K.J.V.

Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies.

The heart of her husband safely trusts her; So he will have no lack of gain. She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.

She seeks wool and flax, And willingly works with her hands. She also rises while it is yet night, And provides food for her house hold, And a portion for her maidservants.

She girds herself with strength, And strengthens her arms.... She extends her hand to the poor, Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy.

Strength and honor are her clothing; She shall rejoice in time to come. She opens her mouth with wisdom, And on her tongue is the law of kindness.

She watches over the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children rise up and call her blessed; Her husband also, and he praises her.
</string>

<string>830 Marriage
Genesis 2, Matthew 19, and Ephesians 5, N.E.B.

The Lord God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will provide a partner for him."

The Lord God then built up the rib, which he had taken out of the man, into a woman. He brought her to the man, and the man said:

"Now this, at last-bone from my bones, flesh from my flesh!-this shall be called woman, for from man was this taken."

"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother, and be made one with his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.

"It follows that they are no longer two individuals: they are one flesh. What God has joined together, man must not separate."

Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.

Wives, be subject to your husbands as to the Lord; for the man is the head of the woman, just as Christ also is the head of the church.

Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for it, to consecrate it, cleansing it by water and word, so that he might present the church to himself all glorious, with no stain or wrinkle or anything of the sort, but holy and without blemish.

In the same way men also are bound to love their wives, as they love their own bodies. In loving his wife a man loves himself. For no one ever hated his own body: on the contrary, he provides and cares for it.

Exodus 15, N.K.J.V.

"I will sing to the Lord, For He has triumphed gloriously! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!

"The Lord is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation; He is my God, and I will praise Him; My Father's God, and I will exalt Him.

"The Lord is a man of war; The Lord is His name.

"Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.

"The depths have covered them; They sank to the bottom like a stone.

"Your right hand, O Lord, has become glorious in power; Your right hand, O Lord, has dashed the enemy in pieces.

"And in the greatness of Your excellence You have overthrown those who rose against You; You sent forth Your wrath which consumed them like stubble.

"And with the blast of Your nostrils The waters were gathered together; The floods stood upright like a heap; And the depths congealed in the heart of the sea.

"The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, My hand shall destroy them.'

"You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; They sank like lead in the mighty waters.

"Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?

"You stretched out Your right hand; The earth swallowed them. You in Your mercy have led forth The people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them in Your strength To Your holy habitation.

"The people will hear and be afraid; Sorrow will take hold of the inhabitants of Palestina. Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed; The mighty men of Moab, Trembling will take hold of them; All the inhabitants of Canaan will melt away.

"Fear and dread will fall on them; By the greatness of Your arm They will be as still as a stone, Till Your people pass over, O Lord, Till the people pass over Whom You have purchased.

"You will bring them in and plant them In the mountain of Your inheritance, In the place, O Lord, which You have made For Your own dwelling, The sanctuary, O Lord, which You hands have established.

"The Lord shall reign forever and ever."

Psalm 130, N.K.J.V. (De Profundis)

Out of the depths I have cried to You, O Lord;

Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.

If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?

But there is forgiveness with You, That You may be feared.

I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, And in His word I do hope.

My soul waits for the Lord More than those who watch for the morning-I say, more than those who watch for the morning.

O Israel, hope in the Lord; For with the Lord there is mercy, And with Him is abundant redemption.

And He shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities.

"For He who is mighty has done great things for me, And holy is His name. And His mercy is on those who fear Him From generation to generations.

"He has shown strength with His arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He has put down the mighty from their thrones, And exalted the lowly.

"He has filled the hungry with good things, And the rich He has sent away empty. He has helped His servant Israel, In remembrance of His mercy, As He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and to his seed forever."

"That we should be saved from our enemies And from the hand of all who hate us, To perform the mercy promised to our fathers And to remember His holy covenant, The oath which He swore to our father Abraham:

"To grant us that we, Being delivered from the hand of our enemies, Might serve Him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.

"And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest; For you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways, To give knowledge of salvation to His people By the remission of their sins, Through the tender mercy of our God,

<string>839 Spiritual Wisdom
1 Corinthians 2, N.K.J.V.

We speak wisdom among those who are mature, yet not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.

But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the ages for our glory, which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

But as it is written: "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him."

But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.

For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.

Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God.

These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one. For "Who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?"

But we have the mind of Christ.
</string>

<string>840 Things Seen And Unseen
2 Corinthians 4, N.K.J.V.

We do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.

For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.

For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
</string>

<string>841 The Plan Of Salvation
Ephesians 1, Jerusalem

Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all the spiritual blessings of heaven in Christ.

Before the world was made, he chose us, chose us in Christ, to be holy and spotless, and to live through love in his presence, determining that we should become his adopted sons, through Jesus Christ for his own kind purposes, to make us praise the glory of his grace, his free gift to us in the Beloved, in whom, through his blood, we gain our freedom, the forgiveness of our sins.

Such is the richness of the grace which he has showered on us in all wisdom and insight.

He has let us know the mystery of his purpose, the hidden plan he so kindly made in Christ from the beginning to act upon when the times had run their course to the end: that he would bring everything together under Christ, as head, everything in the heavens and everything on earth.

And it is in him that we were claimed as God's own, chosen from the beginning, under the predetermined plan of the one who guides all things as he decides by his own will; chosen to be, for his greater glory, the people who would put their hopes in Christ before he came.

Now you too, in him, have heard the message of the truth and the good news of your salvation, and have believed it; and you too have been stamped with the seal of the Holy Spirit of the Promise, the pledge of our inheritance which brings freedom for those whom God has taken for his own, to make his glory praised.
</string>

<string>842 On The Incarnation
Philippians 2, N.K.J.V.

Christ Jesus,... being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a servant, and coming in the likeness of men.

And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.

Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name,

that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,

and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
</string>

<string>843 In Praise Of Christ
Colossians 1, R.S.V.

He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation;

for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,

whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities all things were created through him and for him.

He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in everything he might be pre-eminent.

For in him all the fulness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.
</string>

<string>844 The Incarnate Word
1 John 1, Jerusalem

That life was made visible: we saw it and we are giving our testimony, telling you of the eternal life which was with the Father and has been made visible to us.

What we have seen and heard we are telling you so that you too may be in union with us, as we are in union with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.

We are writing this to you to make our own joy complete.
